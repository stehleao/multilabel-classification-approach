I love the app, I have used it for years The only problem is that with the new update, it won't allow me to add videos. Please fix it.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos   
It would be better if they actually released the messages instead of just the beta;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
Needs to be an option to pay monthly, or to open the deleted pictures and do something with them.;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
Please let there be a one week free trial I would get premium but I would like to try it out first;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
Can\'t connect to server. Failed big time. Please fix the problem.;Sup;Negative;PhotosVideos   
I Just got my new phone and the app asked for my old email which I not longer have causing me to lose everything I had on this app. Kinda frustrating that it couldn't transfer over like all my other apps did.;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
I've been having keep safe since it came out and I hate the new update bc I can't see my own photos I WAS look forward to seeing them and recovering them to my new iPod but it's not letting me  All I see is a purple square  Very upset  Fix the app now ;Sup,Usa;Negative;PhotosVideos   
It keeps saying it cannot connect to server. I tried on my girl's phone and it worked just fine. This hurts me;Sup;Negative;PhotosVideos   
Logged in from a new device as a premium member  nothing from my last one would transfer even though I had it on the cloud;Usa,Sup;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
Or syncing with the laptop. Although the pic or video can be viewed, it cannot be downloaded to the laptop.;Sup;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
You used to be able to move and copy pics back to your photo album on your device.   This option disappears.  Share says it exports to camera roll but nothing appears.  Move only allows you to move to other KS albums.   I'm sure it's a paid only feature now.   Don't put a free app out there only to downgrade it out of greed. Lame.;Usa;Negative;PhotosVideos    
I hate how it automatically zooms in to the pictures but other than that decent app;Usa;Negative;PhotosVideos    
just needs to stop the auto zoom in when you put a photo in the album;Usa;Negative;PhotosVideos    
My main issue with this app is that it is resizing some of my photos and won't allow me to zoom in to get it to full screen. The photos that are sized properly it pushes them off the the side until I zoom in on it and it recenters it;Usa;Negative;PhotosVideos   
The application updated without my knowledge, and stopped halfway I then checked back and it DELETED the app. I was furious, I redownloaded it and experienced the same problems as everyone else ;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos   
Updates have not fixed the problem. Fix the app before updating.;Sup;Positive;PhotosVideos   
A really good app I love it so much;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
A very secure app to hold on your pictures and videos that you don't wanna anybody to see;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Absolute Love it Very Secure;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
Absolutely love this app and its features highly recommend to anyone interested;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Absolutely love this app I pray I never lose these pics I saved. They mean the world to me;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Ads. Ads. Ads. Can't view a photo unless you view an add. Plus photos are poorly optimized for the phone. 0 stars would be the rating if possible.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos    
All my pics are hidden, and protected You spend the extra money for bigger storage all well worth ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
All my pictures were in the main album. Key word were they are all gone now. For what reason All my photos are gone and I did not delete them have no reason to;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos   
Also after reading some of the reviews of this app, it's clear that a lot of them are fake. Not worth the download.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
Amazing app I love it ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
An awesome way to keep photos private and the fact that the app has its own camera is a big plus;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos

App has never giving me a problem and I used all the time Would totally recommend this app to everyone trying to find a good picture storage app;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
App previously had a lot of bugs, before every time I would go to open the app it crashed immediately. Now everything is resolved and the app works great with enhanced modifications.;Dep;Positive;PhotosVideos   
App was great until I updated it by mistake. Don't think about getting a new phone if you plan to continue to use this app because the update basically erases all your pictures.;Sup;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Awesome app use it a lot;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Awesome app I looked at a few others but this had everything that I need to keep my things away from others prying eyes;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos

Every time I try to view my files, it claims to be in private cloud when I don't even have that feature enabled. What is a private cloud anyway I don't have that Every time I try to view them, it just goes to a black screen. Fix this ASAP;Usa;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
Everything is cool except for gifs. I upload gifs and when I try to view them, they simply don't animate. I'm sure it's not my way of saving them because I can view the gif in other apps. KeepSafe, fix gifs;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos

Great interface, really good accessibility with very good security and a lot of options to suit every need. By far one of the best apps I've downloaded.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Great tool to maintain privacy;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Had the free version and decided to upgrade after liking it so much.  Some features still don't work well like adding files from iOS.  You have to open the app to add files.  Really like the fake pin option which allows someone to breakin the phone but doesn't show your files. I keep my id's and credit cards on the app so I always have them with me. I don't buy many apps but this was one I glad to have made the investment.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos    
Had this app for a year now and no problems at all. ;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos   
Have been using this app for a year now. Have never lost a pic and it is so easy to use Definitely recommend;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Have had this app for almost a year, started with free then premium and I'm highly satisfied. Love every feature it has ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Hell Ive even got some pictures of the Bible in here;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
Hi i am enjoying using keepsafe app i do recommended to anyone;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
How can I delete the app without getting charged for the premium since I cannot go back to basic before the 31 day trial ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
How do I get my money back I did not want to pay 25 for the year I need my money back;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
I accidentally deleted the app and then redownloaded it only to find out all my photos were deleted and wiped. Do not download the app;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos    
I added some new photos in my keep safe and then I deleted  keep safe and the photos I added aren't there why ;Dep;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I appreciate having this app very much. Appears secure. Good features.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I can always depend on this app to hide certain photos and documents. Love the trash upgrade.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I can hide my porn now. Perfect app for that.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I can't get in the app;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
I couldn't love this app anymore. Easy to use and not glitchy at all. Every update makes it even better.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I deleted this app after I saved all the pictures I want and I downloaded it again and when I logged in it had the amount of pictures I saved but the pictures weren't even there;Dep;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I deleted this app in less than 15 minutes.;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
I did experience the recent problem with the app crashing, but with lead from a rash review rant because plenty of others submitted theirs, and I hoped the problem would get fixed soon. And sure enough, another prompt update comes out the next day and fixes the problem. Good job team, thanks for looking out. I'm going to leave 4 Stars for now though, because I don't like ads.;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
i downloaded this app about 2 years ago and it deleted many of my photos and i could not get them back;Dep;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
I got this app to keep sensitive information safe. It is not let me down ones. Better yet, they keep adding features to make my life easier. Storing my information in the cloud with compressed versions on my phone saves space and gives me peace of mind if something happens to my phone, I don't lose what's important to me. Photo editing, breakin alerts, and other new features keep me a satisfied Keepsafe customer;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I had Keepsafe for many months. I then checked on it one day, I didn't update my phone or anything and all my photos were gone I don't know what to do to recover my hundreds of photos;Dep;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
I had over 300 plus photos that somehow got deleted when an update was done, you can not contact them for any help, I would caution if you think saving photos here that you always get them, I found out the hard way. I would make sure you have backed up elsewhere.;Dep;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I have been using this app from past 2 years, easy to use, more reliable, secured and thumbs up for TouchID protection. Thanks Dev Team;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I have continued to be charged monthly despite being asked multiple times to cancel. I even uninstalled this app months ago and I'm still being charged.;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos   
I have had 1 issue where, throughout the 5 years I've used this app, my photos went missing. I lost all but 3 of my 4050 pictures. This was unfortunate, but what can you do If you really need to have certain videosphotos I'd suggest backing it up on your computer, then keeping it in this app on your phone. For me, the point is that it's not in my camera roll.;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos   
I have had this APP for well over a year and it has never let me down. I've changed phones multiple times and it has even warned me about the new iso10 software upgrade issues before Apple even did. I highly recommend this APP for a secure way to save your important photos;Dep;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I have pictures of me in the old wife on here reading the Bible together ;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
I have purchased keepsafe on my last 3 iPhones and I have even recommended it to many friends.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I have the free version, and I love it.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I have tried many photo storage apps but this one takes the cake. I am pretty frugal but after a year of using it I decided to buy a year membership. Worth EVERY penny, and I won't go back. Keep it awesome;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I hide alot off things in here ........if someone gets in then the whole worls is at stakes........good product sell its self;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos   
I highly recommend this app.  ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I hope all the best for the company;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I hope they'll consider onetime payment schema.. i dont need the cloud service.. so i dont wAnna pay annually..just need the app;Sup;Positive;PhotosVideos    
I just don't like how it runs out of storage other than that its 5 stars;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
I just don't like the way I can't go back to my deleted photos;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
I just gotta say I love this app;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I like this app and I segues to make stronger security by making six digit password and thanks alot;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I like this app but one of my videos cant play..please fix ;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I like this app it functions very well;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I looked on my phone one day and there were two of each picture. So I deleted one of each. As soon as I did. All the pictures disappeared. This angers me on belief, now it wants me to buy premium to get them back. FIX THIS ISSUE;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos   
I lost all of my pictures because of some stupid update they tried to do which has the app glitching. 2 years of pictures down the toilet thanks a lot KeepSafe;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos   
I love being able to store secure photos. ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I love how the app has really thought about things how you can fake the app is something that checks for errors and then you can log in for the real stuff or use a second password and see a different photo album there are so many features it's so worth the money;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I love my keepsafe. No one can see my pictures with out my knowledge.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I love this app about to expose my girl for being a ho thank you keep safe had her nudes over 2 years and now getting my payback;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I love this app and recommend it to everyone, it's perfect and works great;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I love this app  Tried the free version first but then I paid for upgrade and it's worth every penny. They have improved it tremendously from previous version and it was good even then. Perfect for saving photos and memories. Developers of this app deserve so much recognition for this one;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I love this app It's on point;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I Love this app, I've been using it for years and it's really a life saver.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I love this program   Easy to use, great features and attentive and helpful customer service.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I loved this app. But forcing me to buy premium by shoving ads at me at random times is a terrible business model. I will not buy premium to support a company that thinks pop up ads are needed.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I mainly use the app to hide nude pictures of my sex adventures. In over three years I have not been caught once;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I need my account back I have files that important and photos And or my money back;Dep;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I paid just so I could recover photos I had on a previous phone and all the photos are just black.  Please fix or refund please;Dep;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I really like the new design. KeepSafe has been super helpful to me. One of the most important apps on my phone;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I really like this app and my videos are safe but they won't play. Hmmm what's up with that;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos  
I really like this app for keeping certain videos and pictures private. It's the ultimate app for discretion, and I highly recommend it if you have nosy friends or small kids. ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I recommend I've had this app now for 3 years and I love it;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I stick to this app vs all others because you can delete the app with pics still on it and when you download it back again login and boom your pics right there;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
I think it's great. It secures pictures  everything else you don't want others to see while they're on your phone.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I think the functionality and design of the staff are great. I remember it.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I TRIED A LOT OF PROGRAMS LIKE THIS ONE AND THIS IS THE PROGRAM THE I WAS LOOKING FOR I LOST M PHONE AND I HAVE BACK ALL ME PICTURES I LOVET REALLY GOOD IM SO HAPPY  WITH THE PROGRAM ;Dep;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I tried the free version, upgraded to the paid, and bought additional cloud storage.  So far, all good investments.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I tried this app while looking for options for completely private photo storage, and though it sounded OK at first, it rots. ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
I upgraded to premium saved twenty or so pictures and later the same day accidentally uninstalled keepsafe and all of my pictures were gone off my keepsafe anyway to get them back Deleted the originals.;Dep;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I went to purchase the 1.99 premium for a month, just so I can see what photos I had previously deleted. When it charged me with the yearly subscription of 23.99. I'm very upset about this and want a refund.;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos   
I will cry if I don't get my pictures back. my most meaningful pictures. gone. how could this happen you guys need to FIX this NOW. I want my pictures back. It is such a devastating and heart breaking feeling to loose such meaningful pictures. Please. FIX THIS NOW;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
I will not regret getting this app. Most useful.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I wish I could give this 0 stars, they def should be more clear when saying 1.99 a month that they are gonna charge you 24 for the whole year up front This app is definitely not worth 24 never would've paid that if I knew;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
I would've given it five stars, but the ridiculous ads that take up my entire screen just make me want to install a different app.;Usa;Negative;PhotosVideos    
I'm enjoying the app;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I'm one of those that deletes app ever other week or so.;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
I've been a user for about 3 years now After numerous improvements and bug fixes to keep the user happy Keepsafe has finally done it it's perfect I couldn't ask for a better app Definitely has saved my life many times lol.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I've been using this app for a couple years now and it's just been an awesome way to keep my private photos private;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I've Been with keep safe from the begging. I'm extremely furious at the fact that ALL OF MY STUFF WAS DELETED WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos   
I've had it for years. Super helpful to separate photos that I don't want out in the open when I flick through my camera roll;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I've had this app to store my secondary photo album and I absolutely love it;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I've just used the free version and it does everything I need. All my stuff is backed up to the cloud so even if I switch devices I still have them. Constant updates. Never really had issues with any bugs. If the paid subscription was cheaper I would let mind paying for the extras. But too much imo.;Dep;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I've used it for quite a while and it has been fantastic. Touch ID is an added plus;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
If you need an app that will store your private pictures and is password protected this app does just that. You can even delete pictures from your camera reel after importing them into Keepsafe. So I thought that was a pretty neat feature too.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Instead of making every attribute to keepsafe only recoverable with premium, you guys should sell them individually because I would most definitely pay 1.99 each time I need to recover things in the trash.  I would never pay 23.99 a year for that and I am probably speaking for every other user of keepsafe. Just a point you guys should act on.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
It don't save the pictures all the time and if it do they delete them..;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos   
It is a good app but I would suggest not putting anything on there that can expose person information or intimate pictures it's a app they can access that stuff. Also before you delete make sure to back everything up outside the app so you loose nothing be careful with this app but there is good things to like the secret door or the picture taking of hackers;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
It is better thin the other App out there and it's simple to use.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
It is perfect for hiding pictures or ever just for extra storage. Has many great features;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
It is really good ... I love that I can keep my pictures in it save and sound ...;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
It keeps all my private photos together nicely. It is effortless to uploadshare to app. Simple and easy. I think anyone can do successfully. Great app. 5 stars without question I wish all apps were this good;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
It says I can pay 1.99 monthly which I'm trying to buy for one month to see how I like it but it's forcing me to have to pay 23.99;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
It was really nice to get this apps I like it so much and I advise you all to have it in ur phones;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
It works great so far, but could be even better with future updates. Wish the free version had more features;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
It works like it should and it's easy to use. Can't get any better than that.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
It works so well. Setup is simple and now I have a private space on my phone;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
It's a good app for its purpose my only problem is that, getting photos back you delete or accidentally get deleted shouldn't be a premium options;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
It's a great way for me to store Keyerra's boyfriend's  in my phone ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos

Keep all pics organized and safe;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Keepsafe is wonderful All my photos are not just out for public view when others are using my phone.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Keepsafe puts your files in their cloud WITHOUT ALERTING YOU, then does NOT give you the option to remove them from the cloud. In other words they have permission to steal your private files. They have refused to respond to my requests for help in deleting files off the cloud. DO. NOT. USE.;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
Long time user. Pretty easy to use and nice option to keep things precious to you safe. Worth the upgrade for the premium options.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Lost everything I had on this app, support group said to update my iPhone, I did with no help plus the update I hate. No way I can replace my kids photos.;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos

Great app really good love the safes send feature but there was only one thing that I would change about it. It would be immaculate if you could choose how long the persons able to view the photo therefore not allowing them to have enough time to screenshot it so if you're using the safe sane feature if the person is text savvy they can screenshot it so be careful but I would recommend it any day I love it;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos

After using widget for a day or so text gets all jumbled and not able to take a quick glance at current conditions on my iPhone 7 plus.;Dep,Usa;Neutral;Weather   
Also ever since ios10, where they enhanced their lock screen widget, the widget temperature can be Illegible. Informed accuweather about this weeks ago and it's still not fixed.;Usa;Neutral;Weather   
App is unable to correctly choose location just let your customer do it. So disappointing;Dep;Negative;Weather   
Even a broken clock is right once a day  Deleting this cuz it's a waste of space. Fix the issues first.;Dep;Negative;Weather   
Got a notification from this app suggesting I might need an umbrella today. Went to the app and there was no rain in the forecast. Apparently they just wanted me to open the app, and I consider that spam. Uninstalled.;Dep;Negative;Weather    
I am constantly seeing differences in the information being displayed in one section vs. another section. e.g. UV Index might be 2 in one section and 3 in another area. It's like each section is getting it's forecast from a different source. ;Dep;Positive;Weather   
I got this app about 2 years ago based on friends using it and it was on point for precip temp. Now however it says it's going to rain on the current day forecast but usually says '0' on the weekly forecast ;Dep;Positive;Weather   
I have checked out other apps and concluded that AccuWeather is the best in most aspects. I have checked out the accuracy with the other apps and found that all were in agreement. The only thing that makes the temperature inaccurate with all the apps is that I selected Shelton, WA, but they use Olympia which is 16 miles away. Therefore the temperature is a little inaccurate. Overall I am happy with AccuWeather.;Dep;Positive;Weather  
I love accuweather. Compared to other weather apps this app has been the most reliable and accurate. However the widget has an annoying bug. It has text doubled over other text and the temperature seems not to be updating regularly. But I'm not entirely sure of that because I cannot read it because there is text over the number.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Weather  
I would also like to know where it is connected to that it is getting readings from. It is no where close to any of the reading in this area that I live in.;Dep;Positive;Weather   
Its a good app but the widget has some bugs on iPhone 7;Dep;Positive;Weather  
Minutecast says no precipitation for 120 minutes, but when I look at hourly it says 59 chance of snow in the next hour.  It had chances of snow between 4060 for a four hour period.  It never did snow during that time.;Dep;Positive;Weather   
Not very accurate in eastern Pa. Will show that it's raining but the description says rain starting in 15 minutes. I believe it relies on it's information from airports so the further away you are from that airport the less reliable it will be;Dep;Neutral;Weather   
Occasionally the reading for  chance of precipitation and degrees are swapped in error, but quickly switching between them fixes it. ;Dep;Negative;Weather   
One annoying thing about this app is that no matter what I do it shows me in a city 35 miles south of where I am, with a mile high mountain in the way the weather is very different.;Dep;Negative;Weather   
Reported 2 years ago that it won't keep my location address. Still not tracking right. It's showing weather for my zip code but several miles away on some street at least 2 miles away.;Dep;Neutral;Weather   
So if you want a really good looking weather app, this is it. In terms of actually forecasting the weather, the summaries are a bit too sparse.  In terms of general quality, it's below average, because the widget problem should have been caught in development  it's that obvious if you use it for a while.;Usa;Positive;Weather    
The AccuWeather app used to be quite accurate, but a year or two ago changes were made which have greatly deteriorated the quality of the forecasts.  Even with a specific address in place the Minutecast shows rain when it is not raining and no rain or coloration on the map when it is.  The temperatures are off by 810 degrees.  The wind speed is accurate only part of the time.  The new app is also less user friendly.  I use the old one to check on the month as a whole but that's about it.  This app serves for a very general picture if the weather... hot, cold, windy .... but it does not reflect actual weather anymore then the NOAA does.  I find that Weather Underground is the most reliable and specific weather app here in Rio Rancho, NM.;Dep;Positive;Weather   
The app is very accurate but the only thing that bothers me is when there is rain in the forecast. Usually it will say there's a 50 chance of rain, sometimes it can be frustrating when trying to plan a work day outdoors. Besides the the projected future forecast seem to be fairly accurate up to a week or so and it's very helpful.;Dep;Positive;Weather   
The bad thing is that the daily forecast summary is pretty sparse.  Some might think that this is a good thing. But it can be off.  For example tomorrow's forecast calls for Mostly cloudy with a shower. Problem is that according to all of the local TV news forecasts, what is really going to happen is Passing cold front in the morning, bringing a chance of light sprinkles and or snow flurries in the early morning to late morning. Clearing in the afternoon. ;Dep;Positive;Weather   
The weather now is rarely accurate. Quite frustrating. Temperature is often wrong. This is unacceptable and needs 2 be fixed immediately;Dep;Negative;Weather   
This app has constant bugs and misinformation. It will say rain when there is no rain, temps are off, forecast inaccurate. Next;Dep;Negative;Weather   
This app is useless and the only thing it does is tells lies. Uninstalling;Dep;Negative;Weather   
I like the app as it gives you everything you need to know except the weather alert statement. All it says is weather alert remains in effect til a certain time but doesn't tell what the statement is.;Dep;Positive;Weather  
I hate that now the app only allows you to see minute cast I need to be able to see how the rest of the week will be, what will the minmax temperature, will it rain or not.... I have no need for how the weather will be in 10min;Usa;Negative;Weather    
Accuweather has been my favorite weather app for the last several years but after the most recent redesign it's gone to the bottom of the list. What's with all the videos in the middle The shaded background is gone and that made it much easier to read.;Usa;Positive;Weather    
Additionally, while the UI is clean and organized, it can require a lot of scrolling. I'd prefer an option for a more layered approach that provides more current data at a glance but allows drill down to see forecast details.;Usa;Positive;Weather   
All the words and images are jumbled together making it unreadable. Change the user interface and organize things on the screen ;Usa;Neutral;Weather   
Also I'm having the same prob as other reviewers with the widget overlaying the fonts from different temps of the day so it's useless ;Usa;Negative;Weather   
Been using AccuWeather from the beginning, and it has always been my absolute favorite weather app. Not anymore. They took something simple and beautiful and made it ugly and complicated. Many of the features are so difficult to find, I haven't even been able to find them yet. What's with all the new tapping and swiping AccuWeather  you really blew it. Horrible update;Usa;Negative;Weather    
Clean interface is nice but too hard to get useful information off of.  I just want to know the forecast for the day and still don't know how to get it.  I just use the website.;Usa;Positive;Weather    
Extremely convoluted layout, much more difficult to use than it needs to be, but at least it's accurate. If you can change the user interface.;Usa;Negative;Weather    
Fix the text issues in the widget please. It is very annoying.;Usa;Negative;Weather   
Frequently tries to stack two city information on top of each other making it completely unreadable. Please fix this issue asap. It is so annoying.;Usa;Neutral;Weather   
Good map visualization. Could use a few more additions to its screen. Gives highlights of weather report first then shows map of moisture and rain and movements of the fronts.;Usa;Positive;Weather   
Beautiful UI, though I could do without the ugly splash screen on each location. The backgrounds are unnecessary. Please change it.;Usa;Positive;Weather    
I hate the new format. It's difficult to navigate and now only displays five days instead of ten days Very disappointed.;Usa;Negative;Weather    
I have held on to the older Accuweather app, but I recenty updated.  Big mistake.  The older app had a great, colorful display.  Now the display has 95 white background with tiny, Applelike, fisherprice icons, and almost unreadable font.  I used Accuweather app for years, but I dumped this new piece of trash.  The Weather Channel app is now much better, trying to be informative and easy to read, rather than Accuweather's toohipforitsowngood illegible new format.;Usa;Positive;Weather    
I just wanted a 35 day forecast, without having to tap precipitation or real feel or hourly temperature and having to scroll hourly....;Usa;Neutral;Weather    
I like that I now have the ability to reorder or totally not display  information. For instance, I no longer display the allergy information at all as I don't care for how it's displayed graphic is ugly.;Usa;Negative;Weather    
I like the 120 minute rain forecast. It helps me plan when to take a walk. The radar feature could use some improvement though;Usa;Positive;Weather    
I love everything about this app except the widget. For some reason it doesn't update on the iPhone 7 and when it does update it tries to write over itself. I use the widget quite a bit and it's disappointing considering AccuWeather really is the best weather app for iOS. If the widget is fixed I will be more than happy to give it 5 stars again.;Sup;Positive;Weather    
I loved this app's iOS 10 widget, however with the latest update, when the time of day changes into another forecast range e.g. Day into evening for example the widget leaves the previous font active so it shows font on top of font. Totally unusable now. It would have gotten more stars from me if it wasn't for this. It needs to be fixed. A reboot or remove the widget fixes the issue until 12 hrs later and font on top of font is back again.;Sup,Usa;Positive;Weather   
I really like all the weather related info provided, but on the current IOS, when you add the app to the summarysearch screen the text is illegible. I guess it's providing temps for every day of the week and not just the current temp, and in doing so the numbers overwrite on another.;Usa;Positive;Weather   
I tried this last update and gave it a month. Colors made it hard to see.;Usa;Negative;Weather    
I use to LOVE this app and use it all the time. I made the mistake of updating and the new version is so non user friendly, complicated  frustrating that I am deleting the app from my phone. That's saying a lot because I have over one hundred apps and accuweather was one of my top three most used apps. I'm not happy about this and I never write reviews but I really hope they consider bringing the old format back that was user friendly.;Usa;Positive;Weather    
I usually look at the widget which if great for this app except it's broken. The text is overlaid and is unreadable. ;Usa;Positive;Weather   
It was the best app 2 years ago and it is not user friendly at all. Please change the user interface. ;Usa;Positive;Weather    
Like app a lot Just a very few tweaks to radar such as ease to put into motion but for the most part you got it solid;Usa;Positive;Weather   
Lots of data, but very difficult to navigate. The UX is sort of crazy. I just want to see tomorrow and after 2 minutes poking around I still can't see tomorrow. WHy does it have to be so nonintuitive;Usa;Negative;Weather    
Love the app until the last update. Now script is superimposing on every word. Hopefully it's fixed soon.;Usa;Positive;Weather   
Most importantly, it's accurate and provides the necessary information. The layout could use some improvement, or maybe I will grow to like it the more I use it.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Weather   
My only real complaint is that there is WAY too much white space. I like my weather apps compact with every feature including maps viewable with minimum scrolling. I don't like having to go from page to page to access features.;Usa;Negative;Weather    
My primary requirement of a weather app is to give me a good forecast, and AccuWeather does that. I don't find this app attractive. I don't like the white backgrounds the minute cast is a gimmick I don't like having to scroll through a bunch of suggested videos to get to to the written forecast I don't like having to hit the  to get to another favorite city. The swiping set up is confusing. Butthe radar is excellent, and the weather forecast is better than anybody else's. So I put up with the bad layout of the app.;Usa;Positive;Weather    
Now you have to scroll to see hour by hour forecast.  I loved how they use to have it where you can see the 10 day forecast.  Now I have no use for this and will be deleting from my phone, a once favorite app, sad.;Usa;Positive;Weather    
Please bring back the old format of Accuweather for iPad.  The new format is horrible  The old format was SO easy to use. This new format is difficult to navigate and complicate the process of QUICKLY getting the forecast.;Usa;Positive;Weather    
Please fix the widget for this app, it superimposes the data for multiple locations making it impossible to read.;Usa;Positive;Weather   
Radar is a great feature, sometimes I get lost in the swiping options for different views and information;Usa;Positive;Weather   
Since latest update the widget feature isn't usable. It has overlapping fonts. If I do a hard reset I can get rid if one set of fonts temporarily but then the overlapping comes back. Very annoying. Please fix this I loved it before and would give it 5 stars;Usa;Positive;Weather   
Strange interface... but customizable enough that I can get the weather info I need. You guys probably need to reorganize or change the user interface.;Usa;Negative;Weather    
Switching between cities is more complicated. User interface and experience needs to be changed  ;Usa;Neutral;Weather    
The user interface is great. The confusion caused by the disparity between sections undermines the quality of the user interface. Please make a consistent UI.;Usa;Positive;Weather   
The widget is doubled over with the stats for the weather. It's unreadable. I can't even use it.;Usa;Neutral;Weather   
The widget's text overlaps with previous weather forecasts after about a day or so and becomes unreadable.;Usa;Neutral;Weather   
There will be a few that will post that the Directional Wind Compass for hourly forecast has been removed or isn't there, but its is, user must tap in area and swipe up for it to appear. The default should be ALWAYS visible.;Usa;Neutral;Weather    
This ap used to be better than it is now. No longer are you able to see a 5 day forecast at a glance Way too many bells  whistles that are not helpful, only a distraction;Usa;Positive;Weather    
This one not as user friendly, has less useful info. Add some more useful features;Usa;Positive;Weather    
Too much complicated and horrible user interface. What were you even thinking. Make app consistent, organize buttons. Use better looking icons and make things interactive and usable.;Usa;Negative;Weather    
Used to love app. Frustrated now that it's hard to read info always seems there is double info in same spot making it impossible to read temp, location etc;Usa;Positive;Weather   
Weather accuracy is good, but info can be a bit hard to find in the user interface. So make this information easy to find.;Usa;Positive;Weather    
Would be nice if widget didn't keep righting over itself.;Usa;Positive;Weather   
You don't feel easy working with this app cus you have to look for everything and it's not user friendly.;Usa;Negative;Weather    
Certainly it takes a little more time to gain a degree of knowledge about the app but worth the effort. Did have problems with the upgrade. Had to delete and update again several weeks later. Better now.;Dep;Positive;Weather   
Congratulations the update doesn't work fix this and it's a great app but until it's fixed it's not going to be installed on my iPhone;Dep;Positive;Weather

Have used AccuWeather apps for years. Been very accurate.;Mis;Neutral;Weather   
Having used Accuweather since inception, the best ever.  All the weather info needed   Against other weather apps, 4 stars mainly because of the annoying repetition of v10.01 update which has already been downloaded and update run;Mis;Positive;Weather   
honestly love this app. absolutely no complaints. it is the perfect app for tracking weather in your area especially when you need a lot of updated weather frequently for hunting my buddy got me on this ap and i will never go back;Mis;Positive;Weather

I feel as though this app has become unnecessarily complicated. I do not like the user interface.;Usa;Negative;Weather    
I find AccuWeather to be an accurate source for my basic weather needs.  What I enjoy most about it, is the ability to find weather reporting for my international travel.  Even military installations in the Middle East.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I give it 5 stars  it almost had everything I could want. Love the feature where I can connect my calendar and feed the forecast into that.  The weather info seems accurate on the current conditions. My one suggestion total fallen precipitation for the day.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I have a default weather app on my phone but I downloaded this one because my fianc has it on his phone and I would always go to him for weather updates. I just decided to download it myself and use this every time over the default app. The map is my favorite part. I know when exactly the rain is coming and where it's currently at. Great app.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I have moved from the south to almost as far north in the USA as I can get. Since this is my first year in blizzard country, I rely on AccuWeather whenever I need to drive. It's great.;Mis;Positive;Weather

I have used this app for several months.  It's my favorite weather app.  It's easy to use and looks awesome as well;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I honestly can't say enough positive things about this app. From helping me plan my work day to simply helping me stay safe during unforeseen weather conditions. This app takes sophisticated technologies and implements them into a beautiful app architecture.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I like it . Check it few times a day;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I like the hourly weather predictions, plus it shows actual weather of what it WAS for the last several hours.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I like this app, it's more accurate than the local news.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I like this app, seems to give a reasonably accurate forecast.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I like this weather app much better than the one that came with my phone. I love the countdown to rain starting or stopping, the weather news articles, the severe weather alerts, and the allergy warnings. The real time radar has helped me plan roadtrips without getting stuck in a storm. Oh and I love being able to have multiple cities listed that are easy to switch through. My only problem is that it took me so long to find.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I liked the app before the change. The changes take a little getting use to though. Do not mind that I need to scroll more since everything is right there without going to another screen. This app is still better than the builtin one that came with the phone.;Usa;Positive;Weather    
I love everything. I have permanent mild to moderate hearing loss. I can't use Bluetooth. My ears are too small. Thank you very much.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I love how detailed this app is, the accuracy is amazing, and the layout is very user friendly. I've replaced my standard weather app with this one and have had it for several months. Great app, try it out;Mis;Positive;Weather

I love this app. It predicts weather down to the minute which is very important for someone on a motorcycle.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I often want to check the week ahead, and this app makes that a total pain. It's just so busy with junk everywhere, it's hard to find what I want on the page. Change the user interface completely and make the app intuitive to use.;Usa;Negative;Weather    
I own several weather apps and this is the one that get the most use. Simple interface and accurate results.;Mis;Neutral;Weather   
This update is ridiculous. The previous app was easy to use.  The update is a great time waster, hopeless to navigate. I wish you could make it easy to use again.;Sup,Usa;Positive;Weather    
This new version of AccuWeather Platinum displays much the same information as the previous version so I'm not sure what has changed but see below. The platinum feature now appears to be an annual subscription rather than a one time pay model as before.;Mis;Negative;Weather    
It's still a good app though. It conveys Accuweather's information in an easy to read format. And like it it not, AccuWeather is still the only alternative to the National Weather Service e.g., the Weather Channel although I'm not sure which is more accurate in my area.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I like that I now have the ability to reorder or totally not display information.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
Its POURING down rain, been cloudy all day yet none of it is reflected in the app. It has said  partly cloudy all day and no precipitation in the next 120 minutes. But its POURING Now  The two stars are because the temp readings have been mostly accurate.;Dep;Negative;Weather   
Was working great then minute precipitation stopped working. Really use that part of app the most for my daily routine. Please fix it immediately;Dep,Usa;Positive;Weather   
Ive had The Weather Channel and WeatherBug, got rid of both.  This app beats both.  Best radar and information, plus the graphics are fantastic.  ;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I just started to reuse AccuWeather after having such a difficult time with the weather bug. AccuWeather is fast, it's a vibrant and it's easy to understand  and navigate I am also about to delete the weather channel app  I hope that AccuWeather will remain my Weather go to of choice;Mis;Positive;Weather

Ive always liked this app But since the last update,  it is a little harder to navigate, but its pretty accurate;Usa;Positive;Weather   
This has always been a pretty good app but it now seems plagued with glitches. The latest being a message that always shows Im viewing cached data from two or more hours ago.

I ride a motorcycle every chance I get and this is the weather service I trust when the weather is spotty.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
At night it still gives the forecast for the day. It should give the forecast for the night. I suggest a sidebyside daynight forecast to view day and night at a glance. Like your website. ;Usa;Positive;Weather   
The widget is now worthless without the ataglance forecast that used to be there.;Usa;Negative;Weather    
I appreciate getting the current temperature quickly and also, getting the high and low temp.  Also, I like to know humidity and rain fall in a time frame.  Your weather is easy to read quickly when I am in a hurry.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
SO SO SO bad these days that I had to update my review.  It was fine until they partnered with ABC7 in SoCal now it's just wrong wrong wrong;Mis;Negative;Weather    
I have always watch the weather channel but then I discovered AccuWeather and it has more of what I'm looking for and I don't have all the crazy ads to deal with.;Mis;Negative;Weather   
I rely on Accuweather for my forecasts because I know I can. They're always reliable and uptodate. Thanks I dont like the new format though. Its too bland and uninteresting, and I liked the circular Minutecast.;Usa;Positive;Weather   
Not sure why I still have the app.. maybe for humor.. its sunny when you say its raining and Vice versa. Doesnt always detect location. Humorous when 2 people standing side by side get 2 different locations and then we all try it and see who is together and who is not there and cheating on their mates.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Weather

Not bad , but it's need more options;Mis;Negative;Utilities   
One thing though you should put in the app a manual scan for viruses. But over then that ;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
Pretty good so far..wish it had more virus scans but we'll see if it improves with suggestions. Nice app ;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
This app is great for someone wanting to know how their system is allocated. It's finely set up and very easy to use. However I see nothing about any way to protect your phone other than through contacts It needs to be updated to include some type of hard drive scanning and maybe active more updated alerts. Something from 2015 would be a great place to start;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
This is a very nice application. It is very smooth and looks fantastic. However i just wished the antitheft tracking feature worked in the background if the app is closed.  55 stars if they can make that work. Otherwise 45 due to having to keep the app open all the time.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Even after correcting for a breach there's no way to resync.;Sup;Negative;Utilities    
I really like the UI overhaul in the recent update. My only complaint is that I miss being able to see the list of scanned files.;Usa;Neutral;Utilities    
This is one of the worst security apps that I have ever seen, and it has one of the most poorly designed user interfaces of any app in any genre.;Usa;Negative;Utilities

Don't let the high reviews fool you. This is your basic virus protection for your device. I suggest if you choose to use it, to be double safe and also scan your files with a separate scan choice avg , norton , kaspersky, etc ;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
Don't waste your time with this weak app. It doesn't do anything and is basically used by the developers to try to get users to upgrade to their other paid apps. Pure junk.;Mis;Negative;Utilities

Great security app but I also run others on my phone just in case as I do on my PC but for what it has as far as what it does its a great app to run on your phone and it doesn't slow my i5 down at all I don't have an app on my phone that slows it down at all and don't understand what people complain about It does what it says it's going to do and would tell anyone to put it on there phone It does help your phone;Per;Positive;Utilities   
Great UI, and not much to say. To put it in perspective my mum could figure it out;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Hasn't found anything threatening as far as malware or viruses. But the lack of how well the software is put together makes me question the amount of time it'll be until my device is in fact disabled by something malware or virus related. ;Usa;Positive;Utilities    
I can't tell that this app is doing anything other than occupying space.;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
I contacted Avira to ask if they wanted more info to create a signature and they replied they would follow up shortly, that was last week. Initially reported to Apple in April 2014, if you get rooted after then, thank Apple for snoozing on the heads up.;Mis;Positive;Utilities    
I deleted this app when it asked for my contacts, because it thought it had nothing to do with viruses. It started freaking out and saying that I needed to take action. when I redownloaded it, and enabled my contacts it said it was safe. My skepticism is on the rise with this app.;Dep;Negative;Utilities    
I do plug my phone in to run updates and all, when I do that, I run Norton through the files I put on my phone. Just to keep safe. ;Mis;Positive;Utilities    
I doesn't scan your phone or anything it only takes up space. Don't waste your time.;Mis;Positive;Utilities    
I don't believe in a virus software that isn't a virus itself. Don't turn your back. Be very afraid.;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
I don't have a problem with the security protection or the device locator. I would recommend this app to others except for the one problem I do have. This app drains the battery life of my devices pretty quick. I went to bed last night at about 12 am with my phone fully charged when I woke up this morning at 6 my battery was at 1. No other app has done that to my phone. I would give this app all five stars if it didn't drain battery life.;Per;Positive;Utilities    
I downloaded this app last month and I always check up on it seems to work because it's always scanning and no virus has been detected. However, I have noticed,lately, that when I check on it, at first it will tell me it has found something then change to protected within just a second. I would like for it to tell me if it removed a virus or something has me a bit skeptical and rethinking if it's worth it.;Usa;Positive;Utilities

I just downloaded this app the other day, thinking that the find my phone feature might come in handy someday. Today, I lost my phone. Of course I proceeded to log in to the avira site and after an hour of trying to figure out how to actually locate my phone without having my phone, I gave up.

I love this app and have Avira on all my devices. Avira consistently comes up at the top of all independent studies. I did the research. I have read some of the comments here and some of the low reviews. If you are wondering if this app is worth using  I can say tell you it works for me. You must follow the installation directions and give the app access to your device for it to work  I bought the full pro protection program for my desktop computer and laptop a year ago and love the program and service. I recently added protection to all my other devices. I have no problems with iPhone 6 or iPad Air 2.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
I never write reviews anymore but had to send some love;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
I really like this app.  The only thing i would change would be to make it so stay logged in.  Having to log in every time is annoying.;Usa;Neutral;Utilities    
I recommend this app it scans and fines any potential issues in your contacts or online. Notifies you immediately I recommend this app.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
I recommend you to have at least one anti virus in your iPhone. And I choose Avira, because this is free, easy, and great. No monthly payment.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
I think this app protects, but since I am unable to log in, I'm not really sure. ;Usa;Negative;Utilities

I was all set to give this app 4 out 5 stars but it hasn't been the same since my pervious updates iOS upgrade which is disappointing. Also it gives false sense of security by telling there no threats but then they unable scan your contacts  email bc of my internet. Seriously How so wen I'm able 2 surf the Internet  check my emails. Then I was jus warn 2 keep open, but cn't scanupdate any potential threats jus prior b4 apple update. Buyer Beware. Not keeping this app.;Dep;Negative;Utilities    
I was impressed with the quick download. The set up and initial scan of my phone was super quick. Immediately there were over 50 breaches identified. Love the email option to notify those who were part of the breach. Also, it lists the top websites to watch. Very pleased;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
I was so surprised hackers showed up in contacts and emails. I now know who they are Those creepers are outta here This program works;Mis;Positive;Utilities

I've had this app for several months. When I first used it, it found a threat in my email and took care if it. I have not had any issues since. It scans in the background, does not use much space and keeps my phone safe. I love it ;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
If you are looking for an app that provides real time protection 247 and active scanning capabilities, this is it It's FREE, easy, and NO HASSLE. It also has a handy dandy locater that yells buuuut I'm guessing I need to link it to another accountdevice if I want to use that feature. IE  I can't find my phone. Oh no I need it to yell or I need to see on the map oh yea, it has a map with my address currently on there because that's where my phone is currently at. Fancy stuff.  ;Mis;Positive;Utilities

Listen. There is absolutely NO POSSIBLE WAY for an antivirus app to work on iOS the way this claims to. iPhone apps cannot access data from other apps due to the design of iOS. I would be tempted to call this scareware, expect it thankfully doesn't tell you that you need to pay money to fix the issues it finds. ;Mis;Negative;Utilities

Now I know what you are thinking, it's a free anti virus app so it can't be all that good. But this is pretty spot on. Works great and also has a great location feature. So if you do lose your phone you can locate it. And it works much quicker than the  find my phone app. Great job.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Setup was easy  it works great.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
One thing for sure, it keeps raising a security issue because of ios not updated. This is totally inaccurate since updated to iOS 8.1.3 almost 2 weeks, ago. But every so often same security warning keeps popping up.;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
Outstanding performance  Try the newest features.;Mis;Positive;Utilities

Ran it on an jailbroken iPhone 4s with 7.1.2 installed and it said everything was secure and I had the latest OS installed.;Mis;Positive;Utilities    
I got this app for one reason to scan for malware. It comes up in top two apps  in App Store for malware. BUT I can not find out how to do this. Wasted much time on their app support site. Many people have asked same question it SAYS question was resolved. But posted answers are things like yes.   so if it does in fact scan, I certainly cant figure out how.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Utilities   
This is a great app, however there are some issues that need to be addressed 1 the application should become more intuitive into detecting when you have completed a tasks. So far that is the only issue that I have come across, I will continue to utilize the app and if I find any more issues and or concerns, I will write another review.;Usa;Positive;Utilities  
It got me out of this weird page that was gave me a virus;Mis;Negative;Utilities    
I searched for anti virus in App Store and found this. The reviews were good so I downloaded it.

Besides mining contact and location data, and pointing the user to other Avira apps, this app doesn't appear to be useful for, well, anything.  In fact it leads me to question the true efficacy my OS version of Avira.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Utilities   
I just finished downloading this app so I'll rate it 3 since the ad got me to try it . The reviews make it sound terrible but you can't always trust reviews either way. I'll be back soon to let you know;Mis;Negative;Utilities    
So I've used it for about 4 hours or so now and I have no idea if it is indeed protecting my iPhone from ,removing or even scanning for viruses. There no indication that it isn't though.... is that Avira's logic Its got an email analyzer that said I'm;Usa;Negative;Utilities    
Protected but some of my contacts have been breached I guess. Maybe that's what they meant by protection . It's tells me where my phone is if I lose and has an option to play a sound if it's stolen or misplaced. And let's see.... oh it also lets me know how much memory and storage  I'm using and what how much is free. So far the only really useful thing I've found is the free Phantom VPN. It's appears to be working well and I do like that. Well like it apps I'm sure if I bought the paid version I'd get many more  options than I do with the free. Can Someone at Avira tell how its a virus protection and how it works;Mis;Positive;Utilities    
This app is stupid, does not do anything, is a complete waste of time. Don't use it, don't waste your time. If you want real mobile security go find somebody else who actually does it. The right way.;Dep;Negative;Utilities    
Does not provide an antivirus. That is primarily what i was looking for.;Mis;Neutral;Utilities

Not sure how this is the right a review when I haven't even had a chance to use the app yet but in order for me to get it for free I have to write a review. You might want to rethink that. That being said I hope it's great and I guess I didn't do a followup review if it's fabulous or if it's terrible.;Usa;Positive;Utilities

UPDATE BELOW There are not many apps out there providing full protection for the iPhone  I don't think there are any who do any type of service that is much more than basic.  I guess I feel better having it than not  but that's not saying much. A little more honesty on just how little protection is provided  we don't need another app to help us locate a lost, stolen etc. phone as Apple already does it  so drop that silliness. Or make it optional. I would spend money for something that really did the job. It wouldn't know a root kit if it bit it on its source code. How about some improvements;Usa;Negative;Utilities    
UPDATE Downgrading stars  would give none if possible. This used to be a helpful app  but Apple has a find your phone feature plus I get weird server errors when trying to implement yours and CM Security is much more robust  providing the same info as you which Apple also provides now as well as reallocating memory and cleaning up the RAM. Not sure what the point of this app is anymore except to generate numerous complex Diagnostic Reports that don't mean a whole lot to me  going thru just one is an hour's job And I doubt you or Apple bother.;Usa;Positive;Utilities

I absolutely love my fit bit and the app I do think that a notes section within the exercises would make the app better. Often times I want to track how much I lifted or how many reps I did, even what levels I used on a machine e.g. stairclimber, elliptical, but I don't have a place to track it within the app. I'd love for the app to be my sole source for tracking my fitness progress. It would be so easy  convenient.;Usa;Positive;HealthFitness   
I bought a Charge 2, and so far I really like it but there are a few things that could make the experience of using it so much better. Sometimes challenges don't update people that were invited and accepted appropriately. The ability to resend the invitation to those impacted would be great instead of having to quit and reinitiate the whole challenge. Naming reminders would also be great, especially for medications. And I know there's a million requests for this please sync to Apple Health.;Sup,Usa;Positive;HealthFitness   
I love this app and it is amazing. I cant get enough of my Blaze and using the app to look at all my data. I get all the info i want and its amazing and i love using it. Three things I would like though. 1 Partner with a weather app to get daily weather notifications pushed to the blaze so I see weather on my wrist before day starts. 2 Get more foods to scan or in the data base doesn't even have Perdue chicken barcodes or other major food companies. 3 Heart rate tile needs bug fixes. You can't click it until the end of the day because once clicked, it will NOT add new data when you click it again. Kind of annoying when you want to see your data midday but have to wait till the end of the day to see it. If clicked midday, will not update when you click it again to see the end of the day's data;Sup,Usa;Positive;HealthFitness    
I love this app but there needs to be a way to clean up the log. I have food on there that I haven't ate in a year and it make it hard to find the food I do eat, especially when I'm in a hurry.;Usa;Positive;HealthFitness   
I love this. I use it everyday and have bought several for family members. I would give it 5 stars if I could edit my activity times the way I can edit the sleep times. My only complaint.;Usa;Positive;HealthFitness   
I recently switched over to Fitbit and I'm surprised at the lack of information on your app, although your product has done very well, I wish that your app would allow people to track naps and I also wish that it would detail your nutrient breakdown for the day for example tell you how many carbohydrates, protein and fats you've had for the day;Usa;Positive;HealthFitness   
I wish there was a way you can set up multiple weight lost goals with your overall weight lost goal.;Usa;Negative;HealthFitness    
I would also like to see a few more options added to Categorize Activities, we live in Minnesota and an option for shoveling Snow would be wonderful, also an option just for Yard Work as there is more to that then Mowing Lawn;Usa;Positive;HealthFitness    
I would like to be able to set a reminder for my 250 steps an hour.  Maybe alert me when I reach my goal per hour and then buzz me maybe 15 minutes before to remind me to get up and move.  Sometimes I get busy and forget.;Usa;Positive;HealthFitness    
It would be a nice option to edit your exercise description, I clicked on the wrong choice, it was automatically saved and now I can't change it.  A save option would fix that;Usa;Neutral;HealthFitness

The app has notifications for 4 things. I hope it could include extra stuff, like WeChat or WhatsApp. Or just push notifications from the apple notification area. Why half support something Also, support more languages or add in character support for languages that could be added on a download basis, like Japanese or Chinese.;Usa;Positive;HealthFitness    
The applications can improve with some modifications. For instance, it needs the ability to take advantage of simple OS function like correct its orientation.  It also needs the ability to edit information like the date. I was adding meal information at midnight and it was recorded on the wrong date and could not get the date to change.

Able to get a good overall picture of my fitness progress. However, syncing is an issue. It takes some time to sync over bluetooth. I have charge 2 tracker. It seems that activity sync is quite off and seems to sync in reverse. Instead of charge 2 updating the app, app updates charge 2 with stale data for activity. For example  my charge 2 tracker and app were in sync showing 20 mins of activity. After a brisk walk charge 2 activity was showing 30 minutes. When I synched it with the app, charge 2 reverted to showing just 20 mins of activity;Per,Sup;Positive;HealthFitness

Are used to really like Fitbit when I first got mine several years ago. It was fun and easy to track my activity. However Fitbit's marketing was much better than their products. I'm currently on my third Fitbit Charge as the first two had battery problems. My girlfriend's Fitbit was also replaced twice due to battery problems, and she finally just gave up using it. Plus when my Fitbit does work it has a very difficult time syncing with my iPhone 6. The only way to sync is to completely turn the phone off then turn it on in order to see my progress for any day. I've given up on Fitbit and hopefully will be able to find a better fitness tracker.;Sup;Positive;HealthFitness

I have been using the app for over a year now. Recently I purchased charge 2. When I sync the band with my iPhone app the app crashes almost instantly.

What is the point of getting the hardware if your app cannot sustain 30 secs viewing time;Dep,Sup;Positive;HealthFitness   
I just lost weeks worth of steps when the app updated and rest weeks of data to 0 and then reset my Fitbit to 0.  It's very frustrating when the Fitbit,   App, and website don't work well together.;Dep;Negative;HealthFitness   
I love all the features and amenities this app gives me but the one downside is it won't connect to my iPod. I don't know if this is an issue with my device or the app itself.;Sup;Neutral;HealthFitness   
I never had an issue with this app before, but now i am unable to sync with my fitbit device.;Sup;Neutral;HealthFitness   
I regret purchasing my Fitbit Charge 2. I just assumed it would integrate with HealthKit, but it doesn't. Shocking. Gotta get rid of this thing.;Sup;Positive;HealthFitness    
I want to love my flex 2 but it won't sync with my iPhone 7;Sup;Positive;HealthFitness  
I'm so disappointed in this watch.  I have been trying to sync my Fitbit for two weeks now.  I've removed it off my iPhone and put it back and nothing.  ;Sup;Negative;HealthFitness   
I've had a Fitbit for almost two years now. Upgraded to the Blaze about a month ago. All was well until the latest version. Doesn't sync at all to my phone like it did.;Sup;Positive;HealthFitness   
Interface is fine. Not beautiful, but fine. But the app doesn't sync. And failure to integrate with Apple Health directly means you have to jump through third party hoops, some of which ultimately confuse the data you're trying to interpret. Very tempting to go to Apple Watch simply to avoid the mess.;Sup,Usa;Positive;HealthFitness   
It does sync to your Fitbit, but it keeps changingdeleting my info from my actual Fitbit on my arm. It's frustrating. And it has a blank for more than half of my day on my heart rate.;Sup,Usa;Negative;HealthFitness   
It would be nice if the program extended beyond the FitBit ecosystem. For example, I'd like to compete against friends who count steps using their Apple Watch.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness    
Love this app but the latest update is just syncing over and over. The worst part is that it doesn't actually sync it just goes through the motions.;Sup;Negative;HealthFitness   
My Blaze is useless since it won't even sync to get the time and date correct.;Sup,Usa;Negative;HealthFitness   
No syncing with iPhone's Health app Really Boooooooooooooo. You need to support all phones;Sup;Positive;HealthFitness    
Overall this app is average at best. It doesn't sync well with my charge HR and often says the battery is empty but I know it's full. I have to restart the app for it to read correctly. Would be nice if they fixed this rather than release a new icon color.;Sup,Usa;Positive;HealthFitness   
Since I bought my Charge2 3 weeks ago, I haven't been able to sync with the app. ;Sup;Neutral;HealthFitness   
Since updating to OS 10.2, my Fitbit Blaze constantly disconnects and reconnects to my iPhone 7 Plus. In addition, when syncing the Fitbit Blaze to the app, the connection is initially lost and within seconds reconnected, forcing a total of two attempts to sync the device with the app. Finally, I receive multiple notifications, for one email for example, because of the BT connection issues that have arisen as a result of iOS 10.2. Please update the app, andor device firmware ASAP ;Dep,Sup;Neutral;HealthFitness   
This app has never had a successful sync of my Fitbit.  I can't track anything or set any alarms or notifications.  What's the point;Sup,Usa;Negative;HealthFitness   
This latest update does not allow me to sync my phone with my Fitbit, and I have no idea how to fix it. Have tried everything, so disappointed;Sup;Negative;HealthFitness   
This version seems to have broken the ability to sync while using Bluetooth headphones or presumably any Bluetooth device. This makes it difficult to track steps while working out.;Sup;Negative;HealthFitness   
Unable to sync since updating to 10.1.1. Have done all resets, installed, uninstalled, and everything else recommended by Fitbit and apple. But I still get problems and issues. Fix it. ;Sup;Negative;HealthFitness   
Why doesn't this integrate with Apples Health app. That is the first thing the developers should have thought about.;Sup;Neutral;HealthFitness    
Years after the release of HealthKit and Fitbit still can't get their act together with integrating to it. After a lot of disappointment, I am done with Fitbit. If you can't let me have my data where I want it, then you can't have my data.;Sup;Negative;HealthFitness    
Not at all user friendly. Can you make the user interface easy to use. ;Usa;Positive;HealthFitness

How would I change the clock to a 24 hour clock. Need a tutorial or make the app intuitive to use.;Usa;Neutral;HealthFitness    
A better sleep graph similar to jawbone up's and similar smart coach like they have so that people can learn more about fitness rather than just record data.;Usa;Positive;HealthFitness    
A lot of these recent reviews have me very confused... My Fitbit app has been awesome I haven't had any issues with crashes, and after running around the app a few times, I know exactly where to find what I'm looking for. Bad memory is not the apps problem, it's yours. It is easy on the eyes, very pretty, and provides a lot of information. Maybe this comes with the fact that I have owned several Polars and Garmin fitness trackers and their applications are pretty pointless. I gave up on them within a very short time of owning the watches themselves. Thank you, Fitbit, for providing a product with an application that actually work;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
Almost Everything that I ever hoped for in a fitness app.  I'm not sure how accurate my calorie counts are and heart rate when I do a crossfit wod but great for overall fitness tracker and motivator. Prolly will test it for my next spartan race ;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
and love this app that goes along with it  tracks all i want it to and clean easy read out ;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
Apart from the usual steps and exercises stuff which it tracks in great detail, I specially loved the way I can log my calories as it has almost all the foods I can think of stored in it. Previously I had to look up things and it got really tedious. I am better able to check my calorie count which I think is crucial for any weight loss program. The goal setting option is very good and an excellent motivator.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness

App works great. Haven't found any bugs yet like stated in other reviews. I'm brand new so I don't know much. I use it for a watch and to track little bit of everything else otherwise I'm good. I like the heart beat and steps trackers. Although the step counter is a little sensitive, but decent. I love the sleep tracker the most.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness

Ever since I got my Fitbit, I have been using the app everyday. This means that I wear my Fitbit to sleep, and then in the morning before my day starts I take it off and charge it. Everyday my Fitbit gets charged, except for the nights I have school, I charge it every morning. This app is really useful and it is a great app to have even if you don't have a Fitbit.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness

Fit Bit asked me to give them 5 Stars but right now this doesn't make me happy.  I'm thinking that I'll need to plug an external charger to my phone so it doesn't get a low battery status.;Mis;Negative;HealthFitness

I have really enjoyed my new Blaze. It does all the simple necessary things I would have used in an Apple Watch, though it has better battery life. It would be really nice if there were a few other displays to choose from something  masculine. That would be my only complaint about it. Overall, it's great.;Usa;Positive;HealthFitness    
I have the Alta and do love it. The only problem is with pairing it to more than one device at a time. I keep it paired to my phone for the msg alerts. I do appreciate that the app updates inputs food, etc. across all devices. Navigation is also a bit funky. Adding food takes a lot of clicking on the desktop app until I get the appropriate window, perhaps because it's busy looking for the Fitbit that I cannot pair to the desktop. I also had a problem on the iPhone when I was adding my water after midnight. I was on the proper date, the day prior, but what I added went into the current aftermidnight day. There was no option to correct that, either. Again, love the Fitbit, still trying to figure out workarounds for the app.;Dep,Usa;Positive;HealthFitness

I just received my early Christmas present from my son  dgtr n law. I must say this thing does so much more than what I expected. I had a knock off Fitbit last yr but dropped it in the toilet by mistake. The one I had really does not compare to what I have now. I'm excited about all the things this Fitbit can do and I've already put a lot of the functions into action. It pushes me to reach my goals, to walk more along with being more active. Being able to track my progress is very rewarding and I encourage anyone that is looking to track their activities during any given day, this is the unit to use. I was also blown away when I saw my sleep results. I love this Fitbit, just wish I had it earlier. However, it's said that it's never too late to start anything .;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness

I'm only 4 days in to owning my Fitbit flex2 and I'm completely obsessed with it Love love love it. Bought the flex2 for the swim option and can't wait to use it. By simply wearing the Fitbit it makes me cognizant of the choices I make throughout the day. Thx Fitbit;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness

I've only had this for a day. Had to get it due to an ER visit and admission due to supraventricular tachycardia. I have to keep track of my heart rate and it does the job, even giving a graph history. The sleep tracking seems to be good also. Looks like it'll be a good product and app.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
in combination with the app and I find the information the app gives very easy to find and very eye catching. ;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
Is buggy. I don't like how when I scroll from day to day some of the badges won't change according to that days input. The box badges stay the same no matter what day I scroll to so I have to click on the badges to get the day to day breakdown.;Dep,Usa;Negative;HealthFitness   
Is someone testing these updates Once again, I have lost data thanks to socalled fixes.  And exercise no longer is automatically recording the device used to just pick up runs but now won't record.  Fitbit is too mature a product for these continued rookie missteps.;Usa;Positive;HealthFitness   
It is relatively user friendly. Tracking and notification keeps you engaged and focused on your goals. Still finding my way around it, so it may have features I'm not even aware of yet.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness

If you search in the Fitbit message boards you can see that so many people had their Fitbit Blazes messed up because this most recent update. Ive had my Blaze for a year and a half now and its always worked great with great battery life. This most recent update a few days ago completely screwed me over. Now my battery charge wont even last a full 24 hours. When I contacted customer service they basically told me Im SOL and gave me a 25 off discount code for a new fit bit.

Fitbit HR charge  new. keeps logging out by itself since the latest update. Also not syncing automatically as Ive set it to.

I have Afib and rely on my Fitbit charge 2 for average resting heart rate info and the monthly graphs of such to show Doctor.  As of Oct. 11, the daily heart rate pattern and the resting average is logged daily but it stopped putting it on the graph.  Now I am beginning to wonder if the daily resting average is even correct as it has been 60 bpm every day since Oct 11th.  It is very unusual for the resting average to remain the same for that long.  I have called and spent a good bit of time talking to support.  It was decided that it wasn't the tracker itself, but in the app  Anyway it was turned over to someone else to study and find out problem.  Was given a case number.

Ive been using Fitbit products, including the scale for years. I love the app  Im also a long time iPhone user.  It would be awesome if Fitbit data would sync with the Apple Health App on the iPhone  Please, please, please  This has been a request from many users for quite some time.  Wed even be willing to pay more for the upgrade  I might have to ask for an Apple Watch for Christmas ;Sup,Usa;Positive;HealthFitness   
The overall product is good. However, more information on selecting and programming exercise selection is required. I play lots of golf there does not seem to be any way realize calories burn with arm swing may be the walking works not sure. Much more Golf usefulness can be included particularly considering course information swing analysis etc. I can only give it 3 star because it still needs works and hopefully you will work on it.;Usa;Positive;HealthFitness   
It doesnt matter how many times I reinstall the app, it will not give an option to show the steps. Very frustrating. Ready to give another app a try.;Usa;Negative;HealthFitness

I only have hearing in one ear and love the vibration alarm feature  use it every day. However I also use the step counter and would love if it integrated with apple health and runkeeper. Apple health is not great, but if more apps worked with it, it would actually be useful Up by Jawbone works with it Fitbit is better than up, but as up is more open to change and work with other apps like runkeeper they will soon be better to use than Fitbit. I suggest Fitbit get onboard with everyone else in this competitive industry;Usa;Positive;HealthFitness   
Usually it works ok but wont sync if app is on two devices. Lately lots of problems. Wont sync everything. Says battery is empty when its full.

Goodbye google maps. You've been a good friend but you've taken me in circles one too many times. In fact just yesterday you took me onto 2 dirt roads in the rain only to emerge onto the same road we were just on. You could have just told me to turn right instead of left. Hopefully the person who programmed you to do that is found and fired. May his little games be ended soon. So, it's time that we part ways. Farewell google maps.;Dep;Negative;Navigation   
Google was the go to maps. Love google and apple products. But adding so many features to the maps, google lost its focus on the main directions. The app will recalculating, will get you to the wrong address like apple maps, when they came out. Great new features but will only show the gas stations on a route that is paying google. Or the nearest ones or cheaper ones along the route. But the app got 1 star because the basic functionality of the app is not working right.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Navigation   
I am finding while the directions are good, there are buildings that your directions will lead me to, but to the wrong side of the street. Example. Union Depot in StPaul, MN. The directions will take you to the North side of the road the U.D. is on and you apparently don't take into account that there is a median that can't be crossed, so by following your directions I have to make additional turns, including a Uturn to get to the drop off and pick up area of the U.D.;Dep;Negative;Navigation   
I moved to Salt Lake City a few months ago. Unfortunately, Google maps keep me telling me to get wrong routes to buses that don't exist. It's a mess Almost all the times I have a wrong information related to public transportation. The sad thing is that Google Maps don't offer me to report problems related to bus routes on my Iphone. I am tired to be sent to wrong places and to be waiting for buses that don't exist. Really sad;Dep;Negative;Navigation   
Its been very buggy lately and very inaccurate. I use it for uber and lyft, and the directions and locations are very inaccurate. Sometimes i see the place right in front of me and it tells me to go more than 2 miles away and make a u turn, sometimes it keeps on repeating the same thing again and again until i get irritated and i have to shut it down and restart.most of time it tells me that the place is in the middle of the road.the accuracy of it is more than 100 feet, when finding homes and buildings locations.;Dep;Negative;Navigation   
Love my Google maps, but... you have the directions wrong on a nearby freeway exit by me.

My nearby traffic widget stopped working about a week ago. Now, it won't show me traffic, instead, it will start me out somewhere in Africa. What happened;Dep;Negative;Navigation   
Navigation is very jittery. Map constantly jumps back and forth. Also had some serious problems with its routing. It doesn't seem to send me on the quickest route but instead some random route that adds 30 minutes to the commute. I know this because I can see the road it cleared me from and it was completely clear.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Navigation   
No matter how many times I rerouted it would always lead me to a toll road after choosing to take the highway. Terrible app;Dep;Negative;Navigation   
Since then most recent update, it cannot seem to pinpoint where I am  thus causing me to miss turns that are fairly close to each other and some that aren't. Living near a major city, and being here only a year, I rely on maps to help me get around a fair amount. I have good service and am not in the boonies.... so I'm not sure why suddenly it's hard to locate me for following my route. Often it takes several seconds to realize I've turned and sometimes it rerouted thinking I've done something I shouldn't. Makes following the directions very confusing and unhelpful. Please Help;Dep;Positive;Navigation

Google maps has a illexecuted feature where it will find a faster route  redirect you to save time. This time is often less than 5 minutes. Unfortunately I've witnessed multiple occasions where, without fail, Google will redirect me while I am merging on the freeway, causing me to divert my attention from the road to my phone. The option to decline is too small and requires precise tapping. This needs to be an optional feature that you can turn off. Its timing is terrible and dangerous. I've submitted this as app feedback but I can't in good conscience recommend this app until that feature becomes optional.;Usa;Negative;Navigation    
I rely heavily on google maps to locate nearest restaurants, what the reviews say about a facility, what does the building look like so I don't pass it, or even how far away is my destination from my current location. I believe those are valid questions that google maps was created to answer. ;Dep;Positive;Navigation    
I used to be able to see a LIST of 3 alternative routes, where is it It used to show the time without traffic. Why did you take away the features that set you apart from other GPS apps Listen to your users We don't care about easily switching between walking, bussing, or train Or hearing that the route is clear and you'll arrive on time. You've taken away amazing features and replaced them with useless ones.;Usa;Neutral;Navigation

Since Waze seems to be going quickly down the tubes, I have tried several other navigating apps over the past few weeks. Google Maps is definitely the most beneficial to me. I only wish I could get it to synchronize with my calendar like my iPhone Map app does because that app isn't as good as Google Maps. Also, allowing Waze incidents into the Google Map app isn't the best idea. It showed two accidents in my area this morning that didn't exist and of course, I couldn't delete the false alarms. It could also use a detour button. A stop at the grocery store on the way to granny's is not technically a detour. Anyway, I trust Google Maps will work out the bugs.;Dep,Sup,Usa;Positive;Navigation

Wow. Bc my nickname was already taken it deleted my entire review I'm about done with google maps. The new update is horrible Google maps should absolutely not be able to change your route once you've already picked it at the beginning of our trip. We specifically chose a certain route to avoid a particular area, but because google maps thought it was quicker it automatically changed it when I wasn't looking. This is absolutely ridiculous and should not be allowed I've always chosen google maps over any other service, but after this experience it barley gets a star in my book.

Honestly the new material design UI doesn't look that different then what it was before. I wish Google would spend time updating their map graphics because compared to Apple maps, Google maps is a little blurry to look at, and overall less appealing then the colorful pop you get from Apple maps. I wish Google would implement their 45 degree HD satellite imagery in their maps because the regular view just doesn't cut it. Or have 3D maps. It also sometimes doesn't know the direction I am going in navigation mode and this is not compass interference because when I have Apple maps running at the same time it doesn't have any problem.;Usa;Positive;Navigation

I don't know what you guys did to the Maps algorithm but it's working terribly. It's been consistently showing longer and more circuitous routes as the primary suggested route when shorter ways are available.

It's not even shown as an alternate similar ETA route now unless I manually override.;Dep,Usa;Negative;Navigation   
Sometimes the app suddenly recalculates and changes routes in the middle of driving for no apparent reason, shifting to a longer route with worse traffic.

Very cool when it doesn't crash. Really is crashing bad now. Unusable. Daily filter is screwing it up.

The filters themselves are great.  Processing time isn't too long.  However, it takes far too long to individually look at the results of multiple filters.

Means extra processing and some of the luster's worn off...;Mis;Negative;Entertainment    
Great function and easy to use while creating great photos;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
The filters offered within this application are really quite fun. When I choose to post a picture, I find myself applying all of the filters to see which one I like best. Since you have to select each filter individually and wait for the processing, this can be time consuming. There are some hidden features, in the sense that it's not obvious they are there. You can drag you finger left right on the image to change the intensity of the effect. You can swipe down to create a split screen and move it around but it's a little clumsy. Also, if you want to save the image and post it, those are individual steps instead of selecting multiple actions at once. There is one thing I am unhappy about. You can't change the location assigned to a posted image and they use your current location instead of the location the photo was taken. Since I tend to up load photos once I am home, the location information is always incorrect. I would like the ability to apply the filters on my computer. I'm going to try and print some of the images just to see what happens. I really like the idea of this application, but it's not a mature offering yet.;Usa;Positive;Entertainment    
The ability to mask out the effect on the background or foreground with a single click is magical.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
This is one of the best photo filter apps I've ever used and I would give it 5 stars but for some reason one of my favorite filters coloured sky no longer works. Once it gets fixed I'll rate 5 stars;Mis;Positive;Entertainment  
This is a must app for me when editing my pictures.;Mis;Neutral;Entertainment   
The filters are unique and interesting. Unfortunately, it's not uncommon for it to crash when selectingapplying a style. The lag time for processing isn't too bad considering the nature of the filters, but it could be better. Also, it is difficult to adjust the intensity of the effects it's rather haphazard trying to even get it to pull up. Overall, 45 for it's features you can't really customize an effect that I can see and 35 for functionality. It's discouraging to use the app with all it's potential if it keeps crashing. I'd rather the developers improve the features already present and their functionality before introducing anything new.;Per,Usa;Neutral;Entertainment

Beautiful artwork filters, really fun interactive experience and great results to share.

It's got a great number of filters that you can mess around with and manipulate pictures in a pretty artistic way. I would give this app a higher rating but the pictures that people submit are not appropriate for all ages.

And a portrait one is a geometric one. Please fix because this was my favorite photo app;Usa;Positive;Entertainment   
The Future is here Lol wanted this for the longest;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
I used to love this app... Now it crashes every time I use it I've tried uninstalling reinstalling, nothing helps I've even gotten a new phone entirely and it has the same issue so it's definitely an app issue. Whatever, was fun while it lasted;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
Loved this app when I first got it. Really helped me with color ideas and patterns for my drawings. But the last few updates have locked me out pretty much.  Just repeated crashes.  Why bother.;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
It used to be a very fun app but now it seems to crash all the time on my iPhone 6  very frustrating.;Dep;Negative;Entertainment   
Killer app. Worth every penny;Mis;Negative;Entertainment   
Love playing with my photos  I don't share because I don't see why I have to allow locations to be part of it. ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
It's frustrating that the daily style can't be saved;Usa;Negative;Entertainment    
Read their privacy statement. You grant them the rights of any picture you use within this app. Not cool. Use airplane mode to avoid pictures being uploaded some filters don't work this way but others do. Not updating seeing crash issues as well.;Dep;Neutral;Entertainment   
It's not user friendly and makes the app unusable;Usa;Negative;Entertainment   
Fun to use app for cool views;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
I opened up the Prisma app to add a filter to a piece of art I made recently and am super disappointed that the ability to apply the filters to pictures already in your photo library is no longer available. Will be deleting. It's a shame cause I used to love the filters too;Usa;Positive;Entertainment    
I really enjoy using this app to create awesome Art from my already awesome pictures Lol;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
I don't understand why when I try to adjust the percentage now it instead splits the picture in some weird way that I can't undo. I liked how you originally had it so that I could easily drag my finger to adjust the percentage. Pleeeease go back to this method and I'll use the app a lot more.;Usa;Negative;Entertainment    
It is amazing for profile pictures. It is kinda like a make your own photo instagram. If ya know what I mean. ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
This is an amazing app for putting filters. But you cannot import from your social media nor your photos app.;Usa;Positive;Entertainment   
If hot garbage was an app then it would be this piece of trash. Once a cool app...now useless unless constant crashing is a sick game you enjoy. HOT GARBAGE. Stay away.;Dep;Negative;Entertainment

Fantastic breadth of design but I can't figure out how to access my Google Photos. I am sorry to say but provide a tutorial or make app intuitive to use.;Usa;Positive;Entertainment   
It had great filters that you could put on your existing photos but now it's trying to be instagram where you need to create an account and see a feed of other people's pics. And it's nearly impossible to find the filters now. I deleted it.;Usa;Positive;Entertainment    
Was the best filter app around, now crashes every time, simple as that...  delete and check back later;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
Quality app that now crashes all the time. I think I am going to uninstall if I keep getting the same problem.;Dep;Negative;Entertainment   
Crashes still happening. Frustrating to see such a great app become useless. ;Dep;Negative;Entertainment   
This app crashes when attempting to apply any filter.  My phone is an iPhone 6 Plus with 128Gb of space running iOS 10.3. No reason it should crash. ;Dep;Negative;Entertainment

I came upon Prisma through YouTube presentation. I downloaded the free version to my iPhone and started using it immediately. It is exceptionally easy to use and the results are wonderfully creative.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Many of the algorithm styles are similar and I find that I keep going back to the same five or six every time.;Mis;Neutral;Entertainment    
No maybe it's just my sense of style and taste that I keep going back to these, but I do find them extremely satisfying in the visual output.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
I wholeheartedly recommend that you download the app and try it for yourself. I believe you'll be pleasantly surprised.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
I am enjoying this app so much that I will look to see if there is a different style, even one that I have to pay to use, and download that one as well. ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
I told several friends about this already and they keep sending me their fabulous photos that I've put through the program. We're all having a great time with it.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

Enables you to pretty much make a masterpiece out of anything in your camera roll.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Incredible app. Given for free this Ai powered app is contributing to society in a positive way. This is one of my favorite pieces of software I own, and I didnt even have to buy it...;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
You have to apply taste to get the most out of it, not every single filter is perfect for every photo. Every once in a while you get that perfect work of art. Thank You Prisma.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
The filters are the best, but unfortunately this new version only automatically saves a few processed photos instead of every photo like previous versions used to. The 'Save Processed' option works intermittently so you waste a lot of time rendering the effects which don't always get automatically saved to your photo roll.;Usa;Positive;Entertainment    
Prisma is a great app with outstanding filters..... but please update the app to be compatible with the new 10.5 inch iPad.;Sup;Positive;Entertainment

Problems immediately. Where did the camera roll button disappear to. Need it fixed.;Usa;Negative;Entertainment    
Very cool app to use when it works. Crashes all the time on iOS.;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
If I could give you zero stars for the crashing I would. When Prisma crashed, it takes down my entire iPhone. Generally, after trying about 4 filters, my phone crashes. ;Dep;Neutral;Entertainment   
This used to be a really great app. Maybe one day they'll fix the bugs. Maybe not.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
This is one of the most awesome photo filtering software out there.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

I recommend this app to everyone;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
If I could I would have rated it;Mis;Neutral;Entertainment    
I love all of the cool effects, some of them work better for certain situations than others obviously. I just hope it doesn't take the place of artists doing things like this the oldschool way. The digital renditions are very good but far from what is capable when a real human artist does the same.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Well, I haven't written many reviews before, but this is something I new to let people know. This is an AMAZING app I love it so much The filters are great, and I use it all the time, but while I was showing my youngest sister age 9 the discover on feed, and we were just looking at beautiful pictures, we found some naughty pics. They were of what you would call too much skin. Please, just don't post inappropriate pictures.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment    
Fun filters but I uninstalled this app because it's virtually unusable now  crashes at least 80 of the time.;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
I tried deleting the app and reinstalling, but it still crashes every time I try to apply a filter.;Dep;Neutral;Entertainment

It's well worth the time to download;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
This was an amazing filter app the best.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

I deleted the app and redownloaded. Crashes over and over again. What is the issue here?;Dep;Neutral;Entertainment   
Started crashing AGAIN I redownload and it worked for 5 minutes and then started crashing again. I love this app and hope the developers can figure out what's wrong ;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
Still crashing. Disappointing. 1 star until issue is fixed.;Dep;Negative;Entertainment   
Got this app to add filters to videos, but even though it used to work now it just crashes. Have tried multiple filters, always the same result. Uninstalled and reinstalled, issue persists. ;Dep;Neutral;Entertainment   
For those seeking a video retoucher that DOESN'T crash, I've switched to Brushstroke. The video filters cost .99, but are worth it and reliable. ;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
Using on iPhone 7 with plenty of free space, latest iOS not beta.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment    
If you haven't already played around on Prisma you're missing out. Great for all photographers from beginner to professional. Unique filters and easy user experience is hard to beat I sound like a fake reviewer but it's just really a cool, fun, easy to use app;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Like potato chips... once you start it's hard to stop Creative and fun, I plan to put some on canvas...;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

I used to use Prisma all the time.  Now it pretty much crashes 95 of the time.;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
After recent updates, certain filters, like Surf and Thota Viakuntam, caused the app to crash, but, after recent improvements, fewer filters are causing the app to crash.;Dep;Neutral;Entertainment

App continuously gets better..should have an option where you can erase parts of a picture with your figure like zoom in and touch the area you want back to its original state because sometimes the automation is wrong and a little piece here and there doesn't need the effect.

Have been using Prisma for more than a year, very cool app and no real problems until now, other than occasional crashes using some of their filters the daily filters are particularly prone to crashing.;Dep;Negative;Entertainment  
Today though I opened the app and lo and behold ALL my followers had vanished. I then tried logging out of Prisma, thinking that logging out and in again might clear up the problem. NO, it got worse. Now when I try to access the app it asks for my email address and it sends me an email with a link.  But the link is only good to create a NEW account wont let me access my existing account.  Absolutely IDIOTIC.;Dep;Negative;Entertainment   
Long story short, I WAS a big Prisma fan, but not anymore. Well see if they bother responding to the email I sent them.  If they do and fix my problem, Ill update this review and rating...;Mis;Negative;Entertainment   
It is so much fun to see the different outcomes for a picture after applying filters. I love that you can just automatically save your filtered shots so you can compare later. ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

First of all these filters are very extensive and are really nice to use. I dont use the social part of the app really. But sometimes creating the artwork fails and sometimes crashes the app. Idk if my hardware affects it I am using a iPhone 6 2013 and may affect the performance in 2017.;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
First I want to say I love using this app.  Creates amazing photos and it's great to be able to share and see others photos.   Sadly many members don't use their own photos.  They steal them off the internet and just apply a filter to make it appear to be their photo. It's very obvious when someone does it on a regular basis. Also, it would be nice if there was a way to comment on photos instead of just hitting like.;Usa;Positive;Entertainment   
PARENTS BE WARNED there is a lot of pornography on the site.  Also no report or block button to control it.;Mis;Negative;Entertainment    
Update....The report button has been added sadly my account has been wrongfully banned 3 times already and its taken me a month to get in touch with anyone to get it restored.  My photos are all my own and nothing inappropriate at all. I also have several Prisma friends in the same situation.    I just dont get it.;Mis;Negative;Entertainment    
I havent used this app in forever, but pulled it up today and it crashes on almost every filter that I try to apply to my photo. The filters are gorgeous, but the app needs a lot of work.;Dep;Positive;Entertainment

So frustrating cuz I love this app but I havent been able to use it because it keeps CRASHING every time I try to apply a filter to a photo.;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
Love this so much Very excited about the comments, maybe make it more obvious when someone comments on your work, like how it tells you when you open the app how many likes youve gotten. ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
For the last few days when I open the app it keeps saying problem with feed loading and I cant post any pictures. None of my other apps are acting like this. Please fix;Usa;Positive;Entertainment

It's a very handy and useful app.;Mis;Positive;Business   
I download, on average, at least one PDF a day. I love having this app as a resource on my iPhone, and I love the folder features for organizing my downloaded documents. It's also great to be able to have both local and document cloud. When I'm traveling, I'm grateful to be able to pull up a document without having to have WiFi available.thank you for this great app.;Mis;Positive;Business   
There's no word to say...it's just amazing app...;Mis;Positive;Business   
It's taken me a while to get used to how to use this app in order to save and share PDFs. But the help portion of the app gives clear instructions, once I took the time to do a little reading and practice I can easily share my PDFs with my computer or mobile devices and also send out PDFs to email. I'm getting the work completed;Mis;Positive;Business   
Works on your phone exactly how it does on you CPU;Mis;Neutral;Business   
Easy to use great quality;Mis;Positive;Business   
The app works well for the most part. Really great to be able to edit docs on the fly. However it would be really nice for book reading and magazines if it could be be viewed in a 2 page spread when landscape. ;Usa;Positive;Business   
This is a basic core feature, cmon guys.;Mis;Neutral;Business    
Easy to save pdfs onto my device. I can write notes and highlight. I can scan images and create pdfs. Very useful, especially when I need to sign documents, the signature add helps a lot.;Mis;Positive;Business   
can't fill forms, says such requires use the windows or mac. What a joke, one that isn't even funny I used another app and works fine. Thereby making the claim Requires wrong. Of course Adobe won't say to use another program, and does not even list the fill and sign mobile app, further making the Requires error even more ...errant, ha.;Sup;Negative;Business

Absolutely impossible to export PDF's. What's the point of this app if I need to pay just to export my scans Emailing to myself would suffice.;Sup;Negative;Business    
Good app. Thank you very much. I just wish I could change the highlight and underline colors from the extremely bright yellow highlight and green underline but there does not seem to be a way to choose any other options. Please make more colors available.;Usa;Positive;Business   
As a mom, homeschoolers, Foundation President, Equipment Manager and traveling soccer mom I use this program every single day. I can easily convert info into PDF format and resend to all parties that need the information. I have my documents right at my fingertips and never have to worry about being able to quickly resend info without converting to the various different computer needs.;Mis;Positive;Business   
I sync some Dropbox files with this app so I can mark them up periodically with the PDF editing tools this app has. Works pretty well. Sometimes this app loses its sync with Dropbox and I have to resync it when opening.;Sup;Positive;Business   
Works well, and integrates with apps well. The scan to PDF is simple and effective;Mis;Positive;Business   
This app is alright for viewing PDFs, but beyond that, there is little functionality you can get for cheapand fees are monthly, not one time. For basic PDF editing, such as writing textsignatures, trimming pages, combining pdfs, drawing, and adding symbols, I would recommend getting Notability for a onetime payment of a couple of dollars.;Mis;Positive;Business    
Allows me to scan receipts quickly and send to my Company email for Travel reimbursement quicker than our Company scanner.;Mis;Neutral;Business

Excelent version and I'm able ti highlight important remarks and saved them as a future reference. Very nice ;Mis;Positive;Business   
This app is very fast, clear and smooth. But there are still some features missing ;Mis;Positive;Business   
Bookmarks can\'t be created. Can you add this feature in the next update;Usa;Positive;Business    
It's better to have a webpage like top bank to switch between opened books quickly;Usa;Positive;Business    
Can't show the list of past comments made;Usa;Neutral;Business    
Also an annoying little bug when you switch to other app and back even after you go to the home screen, the zoom in disappeared and the file return to its original size. So I need to zoom in again to kill the white margins. the zoom in will stay if you zoomed in 120 or above though;Usa;Negative;Business   
A comment although it's been 2 years, those features are still missing. But I'm still stick to it because it's elegant, and robust to things it promised to do.;Mis;Positive;Business    
Great app overall, would love to be able to annotate write in notes in more colors. Please add this feature to the app.;Usa;Positive;Business   
I intended to use this version of Acrobat for portable proof reading of documents created on a computer. These are big documents which require frequent revision, and I like to be able to proof read at times I'm away from the computer. Towards that end, I'm using Dropbox, and frequently replacing the file. Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to refresh the file in Acrobat, so I'm totally stuck looking at an old version of this file. I tried deactivating Acrobat so it will reboot, but that still doesn't refresh. As such, this app is completely useless to me and thus gets but a single star rating. It is very rare that I rate an app so low, and it makes me especially unhappy as I'm paying monthly the ridiculously high fees for an Adobe CC subscription;Usa;Negative;Business    
Easy to use and friendly. Tempted to pay to get full functionality.;Mis;Positive;Business   
No option to edit PDF even though I am a subscriber. Anyone know if this is possible in this app;Usa;Negative;Business    
this app will spit out a circle of death. This app is garbage, look elsewhere;Mis;Negative;Business    
This is by far the best app that I have seen in app store and in my whole life for reading pdf. ;Mis;Positive;Business   
Each individual pdf which you open remains in the same page that you leave even if you restart the phone or you open several other PDFs in the same Adobe Acrobat which is excellent feature. ;Mis;Positive;Business   
For me it is worth a million dollars considering the above feature and many other features.;Mis;Positive;Business   
I use this daily  The only thing I would like to see happen, is the option to not have to login to the cloud every time I use the app or even go into the app during the allotted time I need to use it in one sitting  ;Mis;Positive;Business   
It used to not make you log back into app cloud until recently  please fix this and life would be amazing;Usa;Positive;Business   
This app is great other than the fact that it doesn't allow you to create bookmarks, which you can do on the desktop version.;Mis;Positive;Business

"Seriously Theres no way quick and easy way to rotate and lock rotation Also this needs a thumbnail view to quickly find the exact page within a multipage document. Also would be nice to have more choices other than night mode, such as sepia, and other effects.;odo on windows 10 has a lot of nice effects. Wish adobe would incorporate those as well.";Usa;Positive;Business   
I LOVE this app. I've been using it for years. I'd give it 65 stars except for the new update. I access a LOT of excel documents and with the new update I can no longer access the tabs in the excel documents. It's not only frustrating, but makes this app nearly unusable for me since I need to be able to access all the tabs. Heck, is still give it 55 stars even with the bug, but it's very frustrating since that is the main reason I have this app. I hope there is a fix soon;Usa;Positive;Business    
Use this app to easily scan and email documents for my business as a PDF to email to venders.;Mis;Positive;Business

I dont yet have a laptop so I do all I can using my iPad. This app is so useful.;Mis;Positive;Business   
Best program to have on the phone if you are on the move and have documents to handle on your fingertips. Always have access to your documents.;Mis;Positive;Business   
Most reliable and easy to use PDF reader I have used so far.  Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because you cant add bookmarks.;Usa;Positive;Business   
This is a great app for accessing a library of pdfs that I might need to reference and have handy without digging out my laptop every time. Has a lot of useful features that I'm still discovering, and is very reliable.;Mis;Positive;Business   
The inability to create bookmarks is a glaring omission. Other iOS PDF editors have offered bookmark creation for several years now. ;Usa;Positive;Business   
Hope this gets fixed soon;Mis;Positive;Business   
This is a very good app to go between work and home for me to scan documents and keep on hand.;Mis;Positive;Business

I use this app for work. I save medical resources from the internet so I can use them in my everyday work. Such a great resource to have;Mis;Positive;Business   
Is a fantastic app, the cloud storage, the scanner it keeps may reading organized and flowing. The best feature is the compatibility, wherever I sign in, I have my library with me, I can see the document exactly where I left in between my devices.;Mis;Positive;Business   
Acrobat still is inherently best for PDF.;Mis;Positive;Business   
Adobe has come a long way. This app is incredibly useful and the files are well organized. The syncing with office docs is amazing. This is definitely a must have;Mis;Positive;Business   
The only PDF app that I use. I take notes on it by typing or free handing.;Mis;Positive;Business   
Do you like blowing people's minds Adobe I was close to buying a scanner.;Mis;Positive;Business   
I use this app for taking notes on PDFs for school.  The Apple Pencil works great, but if I want to change the line thickness, color, or opaqueness, I have to make some marks, then save, then tap my marks to change them.  It's really a hassle.  It would be great to have a menu WHILE I'm making freehand notes, like the sketch and draw apps.  More color options would also be nice.  The standard colors are ok, but I like to use pretty colors when I'm using pens and paper, so it would be nice to have pretty colors when I go paperless, too.;Usa;Positive;Business

I couldn't ask for a more simple app Just love it;Mis;Positive;Business   
This app has been working great for me in general. It has most of what I would need in a PDF viewer and editor, but it lacks in some areas. The viewing portion works great and I love the sync option with Dropbox, iCloud, and google drive. ;Sup;Positive;Business   
The only part of the app that I would say is lacking a little is the editing part. The editing tools are very basic. There is no compatibility with the Apple Pencil. The highlight option only lets you highlight in bright yellow. The draw option does not let you change the line size, or the color. ;Sup,Usa;Positive;Business    
I feel like the app has the basic editing tools, and with a few more additions to what can be done, it would be the most powerful PDF editing tool on the App Store.;Mis;Positive;Business   
I have been using this app for years to edit documents in the field and then upload to a database with NO issue.  This latest version now causes edits made using the TEXT feature to disappear when flattened and emailed or flattened and uploaded.;Usa;Negative;Business   
This is unacceptable for you not to create a fix The only fix I have is to use the signature tool and to hand write all the information so that it saves on the document.  You seriously can do better than this;Mis;Positive;Business   
This app just keeps getting better It has come in handy so many times It's so useful and easy to use;Mis;Positive;Business

Great app I've got all my related work regulations at hand when needed;Mis;Positive;Business   
This app is good, but there's an annoying side bar that has a mind of its own. If you slide your finger in another active app to flip through a page, Adobe's Acrobat side bar opens up. It would be nice to disable this unnecessary feature, but so far I haven't found a say to do it.;Usa;Positive;Business   
I have traded emails with Adobe support. The popup side bar can be deactivated by going to the multitasking tab in iOS General tab and turning off Multitasking. When multitasking is turned on, a user can be using an application and do a side swipe that theoretically will show all other apps that function in split screen. If I open Safari and do this, only Acrobat pops up in that list and shows all the documents linked to Acrobat. When I open Acrobat and do a side swipe, several apps show up in that side bar. This leads me to believe the issue isn't Acrobat related, but iOS related. ;Usa;Positive;Business   
Thanks to the Adobe staff for helping me resolve this.;Mis;Positive;Business

The Adobe app has no competition.  Handsdown the best in document basic manipulation and storage. Period.;Mis;Positive;Business   
This is a very good app overall and it's good for organizing files. But on reading mode it cuts off the first and last sets of lines on a page when the text size is slightly larger than normal.

Make sure to either watch a video series or read some instructions on all of the functions that Adobe acrobat or Adobe acrobat DC can do. You may find that this program maybe all you were looking for and need in a PDF writer, editor, mail tracking system, etc.;Mis;Positive;Business    
Great app can't wait to get started;Mis;Positive;Business   
There is a major flaw in the scan function to a PDF. I have an iPhone 7 fully updated and when using the scan function it puts a random dark tan stain on the document. Looks like a coffee spill on the paper or something. No matter the light, shadow, angle I can't not have it show up. Fix this and it will be an invaluable tool in the app.;Mis;Positive;Business   
This app works great I use it every day from my phone to scan and send documents and have no issues;Mis;Positive;Business   
I like adobe acrobot mobile version like other adobe products, the only problem that I did not give this product 5 stars is nit having a way to go back to the pages you already visited. I call it navigation history. I believe the desktop version has it.;Usa;Positive;Business

Can't live without it;Mis;Neutral;Business   
I only have this app because I pay for the CC subscription and it is very robust on a desktop. Not so much on the app. On the desktop version, security settings allow a PDF various levels of security. When I'm sent documents for school, I'm restricted from changing the content of the document, but I can still highlight and comment to take notes. Not in the app. Even with this lightest level of security, I can't do ANYTHING to the document, which makes it being portable absolutely pointless. Please fix this.;Sup;Positive;Business   
It is easy to understand but it has a flaw unlike other places where you can go in and edit maybe to delete one of something when u accidentally added more than one.  Overall i would say it's good.  Maybe you can work on the editing part and add it in it would be a big help to a lot of people.;Usa;Positive;Business    
This app has to few features.;Mis;Neutral;Business    
As a frequent user of this app and an iOS developer, its maddening to get peppered with first use and configuration dialogs initials every time you do an update. It takes an hour to persist those settings. Please fix;Mis;Negative;Business    
Also, it would be wonderful if I could use two fingers to scroll while in writing comment mode like other iPad apps. ;Usa;Positive;Business    
If you address these two items, I'll bump this review to 5 stars. Clicking through 5 dialogs every time I run a meeting using Reader to take notes and view the agenda is getting old. I find myself using the Files editor more and more. ;Usa;Neutral;Business   
Can't rotate pages with the free version.  Add this feature to the free version.  Boo;Usa;Positive;Business    
Why is it every time I open a document in the adobe app it walks me through a 4 step getting started menu  This happens at least once a week, then I need to find the document Im using out of the long list. I understand the getting started menu when you update the app or when its brand new... but I am seeing this all the time.  Its an unnecessary extra step.;Usa;Neutral;Business    
I am a big Adobe fan, use numerous of your apps  software on PC, for work, am certified in various Adobe programs  rely on adobe Reader on iOS devices.

Certainly any considerate software designer would realized the necessary of bookmarks. Am I missing something please.;Usa;Positive;Business    
Worked fine until recently on my iPad.  Now whenever I am viewing a page in a multipage document, it will very often go back to the docs first page.  My wifes iPad experiences the same problem.  Can happen several times in a row.  Not fun.;Usa;Positive;Business

The app is great I can easily save and open PDF files. Much more user friendly than the app I was using before.;Mis;Positive;Business   
I until today recommended this as the best app id ever used.  The built in scanner functionality was an amazing timesaver.  Why the current version removed this, forces me to install an additional scanning app, which requires an Adobe ID which i dont want complete with email advertisments, wow and doesnt even provide the same features identify, click, and save feature now replaced with a horrible automatic scan is beyond me. I actually recommended this to my employer for use by everyone, now I am ashamed to have done that.  Will not recommend again.;Sup,Usa;Positive;Business    
This is a huge fail for editing PDFs. I need to be able to use the full annotations I have on my computer when I edit PDFs on my iPad. The best I can do is highlight what needs to be edited so I can locate the edits to add notes when Im at my computer. ;Usa;Positive;Business    
To make this app worse is the inability to create a bookmark. When I am editing a large PDF I dont want to scroll through dozens of pages to get to where I stopped at and Im not going to remember the page number the next day. ;Usa;Negative;Business    
What a stupid app. Every now and then, it all rolls back to zero. It forgets everything you have ever taught it all Recent files are gone, and if you have synced it with, say, Dropbox, or another cloud, it forgets about it, and makes you go through it again. Pitiful. But the price is about right. Adobe, youre better than this.;Usa;Negative;Business   
Horrible at syncing Dropbox files not all of my files from Dropbox appears. I try to use this app to help me with my course readings...but its a hit and miss with this thing. It becomes counterintuitive when trying to force stop and restart the app. Secondly, it forgets that my information has been synced, so it asks me multiple times if i would like to include my Dropbox files onto adobe...;Usa;Negative;Business   
I like this app. I use it for work every day. My whole company does uses it on  iPhones and Android phones. The only problem I have with it is that it needs a better tutorial about how to save and how to type in areas when you have a writable PDF. Before you use this app for work, investigate it, it will take them a while to understand how things work on it and how to navigate the app.;Usa;Positive;Business   
Why do I now have to have a sign in Why does Adobe feel the need to monitor what I am doing with my PDF files. Pretty ridiculous;Usa;Positive;Business    
Besides issues that others are experiencing, I don't want to have to sign in to use my app. I won't update. Stars going down as this issue is not addressed.;Sup;Negative;Business    
Deleted and reinstalled both adobe and Google Drive and it seems to resolve the internal communication error;Mis;Neutral;Business    
Integrates with Adobe document cloud. Save the pdf to cloud on pc, and is available instantly on iphone.;Mis;Positive;Business   
I have to do docs at school so this app makes it easy for me;Mis;Positive;Business   
If you do any kind of work at all, download the app you won't be disappointed.;Mis;Positive;Business   
The latest update has removed ability to scan.;Sup;Positive;Business   
It's much easier to read the document, highlight, and make note;Mis;Positive;Business   
You forgot to debug the Apostrophe and Parenthesis not functioning properly.  It looks right while typing, but in the final document, there are other letters inserted instead.  Its a hot mess  I will have to switch to Liquid Text if you dont get this fixed PDQ.;Usa;Negative;Business   
When using an apostrophe Adobe converts it to TM and when using a dash, it is converted to CE. There is no help for this issue.;Usa;Positive;Business   
A good systeem to file anything, be it pdf or eg directly spreadsheets. ;Mis;Positive;Business   
Its up till now the only proper filing system on iPhone because it is not app dependent. One improvement may be to color the main folders so that they become more visible.;Usa;Positive;Business   
I use this app often but would like to be able to add book marks and have multiple docs open at the same time. ;Usa;Positive;Business   
For a phone based off viewer, this is well crafted, but it would be nice if there was a way to view comments that were previously made on a computer.;Usa;Positive;Business   
I am a very regular user of this App but I find it lacking in features I want to use. I would like more highlighter and pen colors as well as the ability to add shapes to documents. I want to use Adobe to fill out forms but without a good check mark sign I can easily input to the form it becomes tedious filling out forms with Adobe.;Usa;Positive;Business    
Excellent App Use it all the time, to download any documents and have them all the time present in my phone once are need them.;Mis;Positive;Business   
Great things to learn try this great software;Mis;Positive;Business   
A very secure way to share documents. I use it for my business all of the time.;Mis;Positive;Business   
Like a previous reviewer, I was sick of this app opening on the right side anytime I got close to swiping anything on the right part of my iPad screen.  An Adobe Acrobat sidebar opens and I see a list of my locally saved documents.  ;Usa;Positive;Business   
The previous reviewer indicated that Adobe offered a fix of turning off Multitasking under the general tab.  That would be fine if you definitely don't want any multitasking to show up.  But here's the thingWhile Acrobat is installed, no other apps will show up if you swipe from the right  only Acrobat.  If you are in Acrobat and swipe from the right, you can see the apps that are normally supposed to show up as part of multitasking.  It looks like a nice feature.  The problem is, you can't have that feature and Acrobat too.;Usa;Positive;Business   
For now I will turn off multitasking because if I delete Acrobat, I lose my documents.  After I take the time to back them up in another app, then I will dump Acrobat until they fix this situation.  ;Usa;Negative;Business   
The other reviewer decided it was the fault of iOS, but I have to disagree.  At the very least, Acrobat should find a way to turn off their own multitasking within their own app.;Usa;Negative;Business   
Every time I open the app. It has to reconnect to my Dropbox. VERY VERY annoying. Before there was no problem like this. Who every does the UPDATES, really knows how to BREAK a good app. IF it an't broke, DON'T FIX IT.;Sup;Negative;Business    
WELL JUST DID IT AGAIN, when I opened the app. It had to reconnect to Dropbox. It asked me to ALLOW Adobe to have access to Dropbox. As if I have not given it permission at least 10 to 15 times.;Usa;Positive;Business   
No decent radio stations here. Pandora is a sanity saver;Mis;Negative;Music

Im a middle school student and i am also in the advanced choir that competes in high school division competitions. I am also in that advanced orchestra. This app helps me concentrate and study new music. I love you thanks pandora;Mis;Positive;Music   
I'm not to savy with the latest technology, so when I was introduced to pandora via my wife. I'm finding that this music app is incredibly easy to use. I've been able to download my favorite songs with the touch of my finger. So for someone like me, it's very user friendly.;Usa;Positive;Music   
This is an amazing app it let's me listen to all of my music;Mis;Positive;Music   
Be ready for an incredible amount of ads as of recently. Ads were tolerable before recent, but now annoying. Frequent, LOUD, irrelevant, and long. Time to switch to Spotify ;Usa;Negative;Music

Amazing selection of music;Mis;Positive;Music   
I've been using Pandora for close to a decade. I've been paying for it for more than five years. I love it. I've got handcrafted playlists I've been working on for ages. And now  they're all gone. As of July 31, Pandora up and shut down the service with no reason, just a corny goodbye recording. ;Mis;Positive;Music    
One star for this app because it doesn't play music, allow me to export, or anything. ;Sup;Negative;Music    
My crazy understanding was that as a business, you wanted to keep loyal paying customers. Pandora must be playing by a different rulebook. Too bad.;Mis;Negative;Music    
Thank you for this awesome app that brought all my favorite music I enjoy the connect for music I get from pandora and hope the best for the survival in competition. Keep up the good work and god bless.;Mis;Positive;Music

I don't usually update my apps for the reason I'm about to give. I Love My Pandora and listen to it daily. However, I decided, for the first time in four years, to allow you update the app. Now I'm stuck with no music at all because the app will not open. That's why I gave you only one star. Had it been working I would have given you ten stars. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM SOONER THAN ASAP ;Sup;Positive;Music   
THANK YOU SOOO MUCH FOR YOUR PROMPTNESS IN FIXING MY PANDORA  IT'S LIKE HEAVEN OPENED UP AND SHINED DOWN ON MY LIFE AGAIN  KITTY;Mis;Positive;Music

Download a PlayStation in like some of the songs that's what you hear on the on the open road. This is a great app.;Mis;Positive;Music

I love pandora it keeps me in the best moods especially since I'm always grouchy with this pregnancy pandora is the only thing that can keep my mood chill ;Mis;Positive;Music

It's awesome I love it so much;Mis;Positive;Music

Trash, completely trash. If you're in college just pay the 5 dollars a month to get Spotify. If you aren't a student it's like 10 dollars. It's still better than this trash app. Their radios play the same songs over and over again. There is no variety what so ever.;Mis;Positive;Music    
The app is clutch for me in the gym. Using the thumbs up really helps your play lists.;Mis;Positive;Music   
This app is amazing ;Mis;Positive;Music   
I love Pandora. The selection of songs I receive are epic, but those commercials are becoming annoying. I was ok with a few of them, but now they are popping up after every other song . If Pandora could cut out the excessive commercials, I would be in song heaven.;Mis;Positive;Music    
I love hearing all the fantastic songs;Mis;Positive;Music   
And the stations are annoying;Mis;Negative;Music    
No matter what time I turn on Pandora there is always songs that relate to my life I love it;Mis;Positive;Music   
Love it but wish I could add a song to a station as a station seed from the mobile app on the fly.;Usa;Positive;Music   
This is so much fun I love it ;Mis;Positive;Music   
There's many ads and when I type a song another one comes up. I hate this. Can you please remove the ads from the app. Maybe play the ads only once every 5 songs or something.;Usa;Neutral;Music   
It's so much better on my phone than my iPad and it feels like it's an update but it's not and there's no update so I don't get it;Mis;Positive;Music

Always got the best music and I love it;Mis;Positive;Music   
What I love most about Pandora is that I can select who I want to hear my music mood. I upgraded to the monthly subscription and it opens up better music and I LOVE creating new stations My current stations are off the charts good and I'm digging the new Thumbprint station. Good stuff.;Mis;Positive;Music   
There's nothing that I can complain about  it's a great app and has always worked fine for me;Mis;Positive;Music   
Love this app Pandora not only allows you to listen to your favorites, it also introduces you to knew ones ;Mis;Positive;Music   
Pandora is the only streaming site that takes my needs as a listener into account. Love it;Mis;Positive;Music   
I love Pandora One . Best music verity ever. One thing would make it perfect if you could add an equalizer and bass boost some how it would make it even better;Mis;Positive;Music   
I love Pandora I listen most days and find it brings joy to my life What a wonderful idea this was Thank you;Mis;Positive;Music   
I love how you can play anything;Mis;Positive;Music   
I'm paying 3.99month to avoid commercials, but I'm getting commercials every three songs ... no way... I just canceled it;Mis;Negative;Music   
I have been a long time listener and love almost everything about it except for the very limited skips that we get. Don't get me wrong the whole watch a small video and get more skips is wonderful but there are times I have bad service and get cheated out of my extra skips lol but otherwise love it;Mis;Positive;Music    
It's a good alternative to Spotify.  I turn it on when I want to shuffle all of my stations for constant variety, or when I just get bored of Spotify.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I asked Pandora to create a station for Traditional Christmas Guitar music. I'm enjoying the music even now and will return to it at Christmastime. There is so much holiday music to enjoy on Pandora at anytime.;Mis;Positive;Music   
Firstly, I feel the need to say that I really love the music selection. However, I can't handle the excessive amount of commercials. I would be okay with one after 6 or 7 songs....not 2 adds back to back after one or two songs though. Goodbye Pandora. Hello iHeartRadio.;Mis;Positive;Music    
I love this app. It had a great way of letting you select your variety of artists and genre of music. Love ThumbPrint radio. But in my opinion there are way too many adds. I would 100 pay for Pandora Plus or Premium if it weren't monthly because that is outrageous. Besides that, I would say this is a very good music app.;Mis;Positive;Music    
I've been listening to Pandora for so long I don't remember when I started. It gets me through my work day every Monday thru Friday;Mis;Neutral;Music   
I've always loved pandora and I'm loving all the updates.;Mis;Positive;Music

Perfect for those of us who want to hear more of our favorite tunes and less of the other stuff.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I give 4 stars only because it glitches a lot and doesn't reset skips or replays for days sometimes other then that it has stations for bands that usually aren't on apps so I give them props for that;Dep;Neutral;Music   
Talk about randomness;Mis;Neutral;Music   
I love how it personalizes it to your custom listening experience;Mis;Positive;Music   
It is so annoying that every artist channel somehow leads to anything but the requested artist.  Songs are too frequent no matter how many times I thumb them down. ;Mis;Negative;Music    
How can Dr.Hook lead to Dr. Dre   Horrible app.;Mis;Negative;Music    
I really love this app it's amazing;Mis;Positive;Music   
I have an in home childcare and We use Pandora daily I love it and all the different stations to choose from when I go to the gym I turn on Pandora as well;Mis;Positive;Music   
I used Pandora for a long while. I 'built' several stations to my specific liking, but dealt with a commercials for Pandora One or any other nameless product between every other song. ;Mis;Positive;Music    
I switched to I Heart Radio and have had the same success with putting together stations of my style music. The difference is that with I Heart I might get a commercial when I switch from channel to channel, but other than that I can get an hour or more of commercial free music.;Mis;Positive;Music    
The new version of the app asks if you are listening way too often even in offline mode. Very annoying;Usa;Negative;Music    
I've been using Pandora from near the time when they came online. I love that I can customize stations with artists that I want on a particular station. I know there are other choices for streaming music that follow the thumbs up model but for me Pandora will always be my go to.;Mis;Positive;Music   
The only thing of love to see is the ability to thumbs up or down an artist and not just individual songs.;Mis;Positive;Music   
Very nice app, I love it plus u get to discover new music that sound like or close to the music u already love.;Mis;Positive;Music   
This is great for listening to music that I like.;Mis;Positive;Music

They have good movies mix of everything.;Mis;Positive;Music   
Caters to your tastes and the ads aren't so intrusive to ruin the experience. If you want to find great new music while relaxing or working, this is the way to go;Mis;Positive;Music   
It has taken me a few years but I have made the perfect station for me. It's so easy to add more artists to my station or like and dislike. I love Pandora and I am gonna keep using it;Mis;Positive;Music   
Always playing my songs love it  Wish it was ads free tho;Mis;Positive;Music   
What's not to love It's your choices;Mis;Negative;Music   
Works without pausing every song. Needs to play more variety still;Mis;Positive;Music    
Eminem radio constantly crashes. What is wrong with this app?;Dep;Negative;Music   
Never disappointed.  Always hearing something new that falls right in my wheel of eclectic genres Highly suggest especially with pro so there's no ad interruptions  I have used for years and still prefer it to Spotify or any other competing applications;Mis;Negative;Music   
No matter the mood i'm in, Pandora saves the day. ;Mis;Negative;Music   
I listen to this every night for sleep, love the meditation and relaxation music ;Mis;Positive;Music   
Love all the stations I have created;Mis;Positive;Music   
I am a long time Pandora paid subscriber.  While I'm driving more and more the app pops up a solicitation for feedback and upgrade.  In California it is illegal to text or touch your phone while driving.  Once the solicitation is up you can't see your music or playing station.  This is very distracting and to switch back you have to break the law and touch your screen to decline. ;Usa;Negative;Music    
Today I finally hit the decline and inadvertently touched the 12.99 upgrade.  I had to pull over while on the highway so it didn't charge me This is not reasonable.  ;Usa;Neutral;Music    
PLEASE REMOVE SOLICITATION FOR PAID SUBSCRIPTIONS. OR AT LEAST REMOVE WHILE DRIVING. IT IS UNSAFE.;Usa;Positive;Music    
Long time pandora user. Love love love this app;Mis;Positive;Music

Love that I can listen to bands that I like and then something completely new. Be introduced to other great bands, or reintroduced to bands I haven't heard from in a long time.;Mis;Positive;Music   
Pandora is the best music app. Great variety to your stations and really pays attention to what you're listening to like they almost know you're mood. ;Mis;Positive;Music   
A skip or two more would be nice but that's it.;Usa;Positive;Music   
The only downsides are every day a channel that I'm listening to suddenly says, Channel unavailable and it'll go Are you still listening.  Dude  I'm riding my motorcycle, just keep playing music, Wth;Usa;Negative;Music    
So I need an account if I want to use this, but when I finish It keeps telling me I am unable to sign in;Mis;Neutral;Music

I love this app, When you choose your favorite artist or song you can set it as a station  as similar songs  artists play you can likeor dislike with thumbs up or down so your liked songs play more often  disliked won't play again. With the free version there aren't many ads  they're short  quick so it's not bothersome.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I love pandora so much when I received free premium I was listening to music with no ads it was the best too bad I only have 7 days free premium I wish I had it forever. After I got premium I was listening to pandora like no tomorrow I kinda wish the offline version is with the free version that would be lit. Also I wish they can take it easy with the ads because it's like watching tv you get those dumb annoying commercials that's the reason why I don't watch it anymore but yeah ads are severely annoying so I just ask please take off the ads for customer sake;Usa;Positive;Music

I don't know what I would of done without Pandora during some really hard times I've had recently. Music helps me better than any pill, person, hypnosis, whatever it may be. Again thank you and I'll be updating to premium here in the next few days when I've got the money;Mis;Positive;Music   
Thanks for the good music;Mis;Positive;Music   
I love how pandora works very hard to satisfy their customerssubscribers I've been satisfied with pandora since 2012.;Mis;Positive;Music   
Nothing to complain about ;Mis;Negative;Music   
From an East Bay resident for over 20 years and now living in Gulf Shores, Alabama, your wonderful collection of music is a wonder to hear on our beautiful, sugarywhite sandy beaches. Thanks for the great job  ;Mis;Positive;Music   
Never had a problem with the app crashing until  recently. Considering switching to a different source for my music fix.;Dep;Negative;Music   
Main problem is crashing and you did an update to reduce the number of crashes, yet it crashes more now...;Dep;Negative;Music   
This app is CONSTANTLY buffering my music and wont play. 3 out of 5 times when I open it to play a song it just says buffering and it wont play anything. AND IM PAYING FOR IT Wont be for very long though...;Per,Usa;Negative;Music   
After every 45 songs, youll get a minutes worth of adds. Its not that bad, but still annoying they want us to buy the ad free one. Also it been crashing a lot lately. Its been so aggravating that I actually downloaded Spotify because of it;Dep,Usa;Neutral;Music   
After the last update I havent been able to play any music on any of my apple devices through the app. I just keep getting the message that my station is buffering and will be right back... Before now I have never had any problems and have always relied on Pandora for some good music ;Per,Sup,Usa;Positive;Music   
Since the last update 3 days ago, my stations have randomly paused themselves, skipped songs and not just in the middle of the song, its like someone is repeatedly holding down the skip button, just just closed out. I need the music to help me sleep and this is doing the total opposite. Also, not a fan of having to click through multiple screens to switch stations.;Dep,Sup,Usa;Positive;Music   
Whenever I use the app, a couple of songs in, the app crashes and my phone restarts automatically.;Dep;Neutral;Music   
The Vogues channel is a compilation of the  very best music ever produced. Thank you Pandora for allowing us to travel back in time and enjoy this journey with this timeless music;Mis;Positive;Music   
Very sad about this new pa Dora not being so good. Just keeps crashing on me and freezing. Not sure why its been downhill for a while now. I wish they would make work correctly.;Dep;Positive;Music   
Thank u pandora for getting me threw sum very sad times and emotional days .... gospel stations r my LIFE;Mis;Negative;Music   
The app needs an overhaul for sure. Crashes about every 15 on an Apple Watch and most of the time it takes about 30 seconds to load the app no matter what the connection speed is. These times are way worse when connected to Apple play in my car.;Dep,Per,Usa;Negative;Music   
Last update is making my iPhone 7 not working with radio;Dep,Sup;Neutral;Music   
extremely slow loading on my iphone the last several days and then skips songs all. the. time. usually half way through one i really like.;Dep,Per,Usa;Positive;Music   
has completely stopped working on my vizio tvs and glitches cannot support all the time on both my bluray players. Add better streaming mechanism in the app and fix the issues.;Sup;Negative;Music    
paid for a subscription for my son as well and it charges but wont register on his iphone so it still plays ads.;Usa;Positive;Music   
plays only the same handful of songs, no matter what you thumbs updown or add to the station. have an all female based country music station, only plays male artists plays NONE of the artists on the suggestion list. NONE. ;Mis;Positive;Music    
totally done with pandora. cancellingdeleting and switching to amazon music.;Mis;Positive;Music    
New version force closes everything for no reason. Not happy when Im working out and lose everything. And the amount and length of commercials is ridiculous.;Usa;Negative;Music   
Too many commercials but plays all my favorite songs ..;Mis;Positive;Music    
Asked me 3 times in a row if I wanted to review Pandora. I clicked no. It kept asking immediately. So here is your review.;Mis;Negative;Music    
Wish i could atleast choose what type of ads I'd prefer to hear over and over again. Why yall gotta play the same ones a million times;Mis;Positive;Music    
until this last update. Used 80 of my battery in four hours. Not acceptable.;Per;Positive;Music   
Love that you can customize your songs and that you can give a thumbs up or down to what you like so you know I love all kinds of artist s and music and it allows the switches easily.  Like descriptions of artists too;Mis;Positive;Music   
There are more ads playing than there is music. Please try to limit them;Mis;Positive;Music    
Listen all the time. I pay per month but it's the best money spent.;Mis;Positive;Music   
Its good but not the greatest you cant pay for it so thats ok;Mis;Positive;Music    
I love pandora because it has so much nice music and I can just jam out to my favorite songs I will definitely recommend it ;Mis;Positive;Music   
I updated my iPhone to iOS 11 and now I cant use my headphones to control pandora.;Sup,Usa;Neutral;Music   
I also use a VPN and cannot use Pandora. Even when using a IP address in the US.;Sup,Usa;Neutral;Music   
Both of these seem like fixable problems, so this rating is mostly out of disappointment of pandora.;Dep;Negative;Music   
Updated app, boom required video ads. I have to now start Pandora, watch the ad THEN plug it into my car to maybe listen to music if it doesn't glitch. Also when the app suddenly stops playing music, you guessed it. Gotta unplug from car, watch ad, reconnect phone. They are really pushing the paid version now. I Heart radio here I come I guess, it was a good decade Pandora but Im out.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I am a pandora premium user and Ive had no problems with the APP since the last update. Now the playlist randomly stops, skips, and its frustrating. I like Pandora but its more annoying now than useful.;Usa;Negative;Music   
I know that this is the way that make money, but it has become obsessive. Now they have not only placed them in between a few songs, but where the album covers are Very annoying;Usa;Negative;Music    
Dont know what Id do without Pandora;Mis;Neutral;Music   
Its freezing every other song. Paying 15 a month and dealing with this frustration is not worth. Literally needs to be fixed ASAP;Per;Negative;Music   
It has not been working afternoon updates ;Sup;Neutral;Music   
Love using pandora i am a freshman i high school and everybody listens to all this modern day music.  I love old country so i love that i can put my headphones in and tune out all their trash. Thank you again;Mis;Positive;Music   
It restarts my phone and shuts off every time I open it;Dep;Neutral;Music   
But every couple songs it stops to ask are you still listening. Yes I am still listening. Annoying as fk ;Usa;Negative;Music    
To many ads reduce it to an add every 2,000 songs. Not even kidding. It is very annoying.;Usa;Negative;Music    
This is a great app...when it's working.  shuffle feature is very nice to bounce between Excision and Jonny Cash.;Mis;Positive;Music  
Pandora knocks the rocks out my socks Wont ever double cross They got the sauce, ever since lift off;Mis;Neutral;Music   
It is very good app for music listening, but it started accidentally turns off on iOS 11. Its just doesnt work properly and turns off by itself.;Sup,Usa;Negative;Music  
Everybody should be able to replay and Download music not pay for it its not fair not everyone has that kind of money;Usa;Negative;Music    
Today I deleted this app out of disgust. My twin brother is dying today and I was playing Enya but was horrified when all these commercials started playing  the last thing he needs right now is health insurance.;Mis;Negative;Music    
I love pandora Its lets me listen to my favorite songs for free I dont think I would live without it ;Mis;Positive;Music   
I just updated my phone and Pandora is still crashing It's been doing this for months Nothing is fixed;Dep,Sup,Usa;Neutral;Music   
Pandora has a wide selection of music.  You have the option for commercials, or to pay for commercial free.  After listening on a commercial channel, you are offered a commercial free hour after you listen to a sponsors ad  Love the variety;Mis;Positive;Music   
Wish everybody would be on pandora so great;Mis;Positive;Music   
The only app that gets worse with every update Not only will it crash on you randomly but it will also prevent you from connecting even with a solid network connection;Dep,Usa;Negative;Music   
And I love being able to make my own channels and not pay. But my app crashes several times a day and my phone does a mini restart. Its frustrating;Dep,Usa;Positive;Music  
Normally a great appservice. But recent releases have had a lot of buffering issues on fast wifi and 4g. Reinstalling app helps but then app has been crashing. Theyre slipping on QA.;Per,Sup,Usa;Positive;Music   
Consentrate exercise my brain just like my body;Mis;Positive;Education   
As we eat older we lose brain cells. Lumosity is helping me keep younger at heart and mind.  Thanks Lumosity;Mis;Positive;Education   
I gotta tell U I enjoy these games but some of the game that show  ICON EVERY GODDAM TIME U GET IT CORRECT IS SOOOO ANNOYING AND GET IN THE WAY OF ME GETTING IT PERFECT FAST. Please fix this. I want better scores but that stupid thing gets annoyingly distracting. I really think training the brain is cool but seriously get rid of the check icon andor whatever the game shows on the screen that is not part of the game whenever I get it right. It's like dealing with a stupid happy teacher that compliments every time a student gets something right been thru that lol, and it's not a big deal that I get right each time, I wanna get more right faster so get out of my way lol.;Usa;Positive;Education   
Another thing I want to mention is that the multitasking train game... I guess it's supposed to test u on prioritizing skill too but if that's the case then it should consider the player's color of preference too, I think. Last but not least, I also want to point out that the game should ask if the tv or loud music is on, what kind of distractions a player may be experiencing before she plays these games every time so that the system is aware of the ability of the player. I did notice that it asked me a couple of times how many hours I slept but it doesn't every time so what's the about I do play the free version so I don't know what the paid version offers but so far I'm not so impressed tho I do enjoy the game more than other free games that I seldom play that probably doesn't train my brain as much as Lumosity games. ;Mis;Positive;Education    
And if you really want to train people's brain, maybe make it so that it trains the emotional intelligence part too I'm waiting lol.;Mis;Positive;Education    
Encuentro a Lumosity casi adictivo, increble como se ve el progreso, quiero tener una mente mas enfocada mejorar mi memoria y esta app siento que me ayuda a lograr esos objetivos, ademas es entretenidisimo. Recomedada 100;Mis;Neutral;Education   
This game really gives you a workout  It's fun, fast, and fabulous  It's also very encouraging and positive. You want to keep trying and it is NOT boring. Enjoy;Mis;Positive;Education   
I've been concerned about my memory recently so decided to try this. It's still early on but I'm enjoying it;Mis;Positive;Education   
Used to subscribe to this app, and I loved it. Since then I removed myself from Facebook, and now it won't let me create an account though gmail. Oh well..;Sup;Positive;Education   
This app does not let kids who would like to strengthen their brain use the app. I am eleven years old and it would not let me use it. I simply wanted to strengthen my brain and know where I was along the path of strengthening it. I would give it one star because of this.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I use the free account, so when I'm done with my daily exercise there are only 3 options for games to play.;Mis;Positive;Education    
I have developed cognitive problems due to my Multiple Sclerosis and I need this site along with my reading for therapy.;Mis;Negative;Education    
I probably won't regain what I have lost, but I need to prevent any more loss.;Mis;Negative;Education    
I noticed that I was starting to have problems paying attention to anything and I started to use this app. I feel like it's really helping Love it;Mis;Positive;Education   
Great app to keep your brain exercised.  Just like you should exercise your body, you need to do the same with your brain.  This does that in a fun engaging way.;Mis;Positive;Education

After suffering TBI no worries, full recovery , this app was recommended by one of my therapists.  It is a fun way to exercise cognitive skills. ;Mis;Negative;Education   
I would like it if it asked how I felt for each session, and provided reporting around the different states.  For a normal person, the unhappy face means you had a bad day, for someone with TBI, it can mean extreme pain, difficulty paying attention, double vision, and various other issues.  Needless to say, it would be nice to see my performance difference between my worst condition and my best.;Usa;Negative;Education    
Any time you can waste time and sharpen your mind at the same time is a good use of your wasted time;Mis;Negative;Education   
It is very educational but the reason I gave it four stars is because it should be open to all ages that appreciate learning. Lumos Labs really needs to work on that;Mis;Positive;Education    
Great app that gets your brain working.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Great mental workout;Mis;Positive;Education   
The games are fun and I mean I'm only 12 but why can't I play games 3  4. I want to know what these games are.;Mis;Neutral;Education    
They are fun games and the best part is to see how your performance improves with the practice. They look simple but they challenge your skills.;Mis;Positive;Education

I love this It really helps to improve your brain I feel the difference and lately I've been using it every day. Kind of games I've always liked play. I really believe in The app.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Fun app. Would be great if the free version can offer a few more games;Mis;Positive;Education   
It was fun and pretty good, but then it gets to the end of the 3 trials and it tells you that you have to pay money monthly to use the app. All the other games aside from the 3 trial ones are locked, so you can't even test them out.;Mis;Positive;Education    
Great brain trainers  I really like this app.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I've been using the app for a couple days now and I've had no problems as of right now. The only thing that annoys me is the fact that we have to do the workout around the same time each day. Sometimes I'm not available at that time the next day.;Mis;Negative;Education    
If you have absolutely  positively nothing to do for 5 minutes then this'll entertain you and make you think at the same time. A very constructive mental workout that will pass the time quickly.;Mis;Positive;Education    
Has helped me after my car accident. Couldn't remember details because of head injury. Am much better and improving every time I do this training;Mis;Negative;Education   
I think this app can really help me I'm in love with it Thank you for making it;Mis;Positive;Education   
I play these games first thing every morning, it does a better job waking me up than  coffee.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Lumosity has put some of my anxieties of having presenile dementia just by seeing that I scored well on the brain games that really test your cognitive abilities. Thanks Lumosity;Mis;Positive;Education   
Wow  What fun, think I'm hooked, and I think I see where I need to work.  I look forward to seeing what comes next.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I began playing these games to sharpen my brain skills for current use and to help offset my chances of getting Alzheimer's. ;Mis;Positive;Education   
I can attest that it sharpens my thinking right now and doing them in the morning helps my cognitive skills throughout the day. I recommend this for every age group but believe it is imperative for anyone over 45 years old. I bought this game for every member of my family include my 86 year old mother and 89 year old father. ;Mis;Negative;Education   
Brain skills can always be improved and taking 1015 minutes a day to do so is a negligible price to pay.;Mis;Positive;Education   
You guys should create a cause and effect game. Maybe in the style of a detective. Also, it would help to teach people with logic.;Mis;Positive;Education    
I just tried it for the first time and it's awesome Why waist my time with candy crush when I can play these games, they are just as much fun and I'm keeping my mind sharp;Mis;Positive;Education

I love this app. I can't play all the games whenever I want, but I really like the fact that it's a surprise as to which ones I'll play the next day. This app is a lot better than Peak. I can at least go back and play the brain games more if I have completed that days training, for myself. Peak ask for you to pay to play them more than once that day.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is lots of fun. I love to do this while watching tv. Gives me something productive to do instead of staring into a lit screen.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This app is amazing;Mis;Positive;Education

I loved playing some of the games. I decided to pay 11.99mo so I could play any of the games without being locked out. It has been two days and i touch app and then it just goes back to home screen. I even did the update and it still won't let me play. I hope I will not be charged for this and I will cancel. Sad because I'm addicted to getting those trains into the stations.;Usa;Positive;Education   
When i got luminosity and typed in my birthdate it told me i was illegible to create an account. So, naturally i just thought it was because of the COPPA policy in the U.S where you have to be 13 to create an account on appswebsites like social media. But when i changed the year to make myself 13 it still said i was illegible. Um, what So it isn't the COPPA policy. You guys just won't allow younger kids to participate in using this app to grow their minds This app is rated 4 so i'm confused as to why the creators of luminosity would have an account age restriction that's pretty low.;Mis;Positive;Education    
Loving it and I like to do this in the morning and Peak at night.  Problem is that they copy from each other and the games are similar. They started with different  games but now 95 are identical.   Come on stop cheating. They had them first.  Although I do love the program.   You are 100 times more expensive.  Lifetime is the same on peak as your monthly;Mis;Positive;Education

Having used it long enough, I now can compare my strengths and weaknesses during different periods in my life.

Hope this helps.;Mis;Positive;Education    
I like the app however, read an interesting article in the newspaper today that what the ;Mis;Positive;Education   
exercises claims to do for the brain is unproven. Company paid millions in fines due to misleading advertising. Will continue to subscribe and play the games for enjoyment;Mis;Positive;Education    
The app is cool  at first it was really intriguing but after a few days, the games seem repetitive. Since I don't have premium other games are locked ,  I only have access to 3 games which will get pretty boring if you ask me. Other than that everything works fine.;Mis;Positive;Education    
I love this game it s ur brain get stronger but the one thing im going to say is when u do ur daily exercise u get the games and u can play them again but when the exercise games change u cant play the ones on ur last exercise so plz fix but five starsalso i need to know if how old u are effects it because im way older than 4 years old but iwant some challenging stuff as well tks for reading ;Usa;Positive;Education    
Smart brain teaser games. Good to get the blood flowing between the ears.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I found it great but hate how it's not for kids;Mis;Negative;Education    
It is a great and fun game that tests you skills and such, but if you don't pay for the full version you only get 3 games to play to train you mind or whatever, if you pay for the Premium Training which is around 5 then you get everything else. I defiantly don't think this is fair and believe that if you don't pay for the premium training you should at least get 23 games from each category.;Mis;Positive;Education    
This app is great I have trouble remembering things but with these games it has really helped with keeping my mind active and staying alert.;Mis;Positive;Education

I had to delete the app and get it again to then put myself as an 18 year old just to boost my brain activity up and play some puzzles.;Mis;Positive;Education

I bought a 1yr subscription after trying some games because I liked the games  puzzles and the app overall, not in response to the claims for improvement in cognition or thinking. ;Mis;Positive;Education

I think Luminosity is wonderful. The exercise Tidal Treasures  is much to long because it has 3 turns. I feel 1 turn would be enough, thus constraining on the one without thinking that this has to be done 2 more times;Usa;Positive;Education    
Fantastic I love playing it everyday ;Mis;Positive;Education   
It's really brain training;Mis;Neutral;Education   
I have a few brain training games that are paid annually. This one took me by surprise. I had no idea what a great app this would be being that I wasn't familiar with any companies backing it such as Rosetta Stone and FitBrains etc... I'm a paying member of three different ones  the two I named and one other. And, I really like this one because of a few reasons, but mainly because of the variety of games and the variety of brain areas that it challenges. The others do too and are excellent, but they hide their variety well which is good in many ways , but for some reason I prefer the way Lumosity does it.;Mis;Positive;Education

App would be better if the company cared about the people that purchase their product. Don't dare contact support they will treat you like you're a moron and talk down to you. No help what so ever.

Well I believe that this app is worth getting, honestly, it's really fun. BUT, my only problem with it is that I get bored easy, and you can only play the games for one day, and you get three games a day considered to be a workout. So if I really like this one game, I can play it for one day, then the next day I'll do my workout then it'll be locked again.;Mis;Positive;Education

I like the App itself. The games are good and seem to do what they state. My problem is with the description. When I purchased it through the App Store, it clearly states that it allows Family Share. The description doesn't state that a Family account has to be purchased on Lumosity's website NOT through the App Store. So I purchased the year subscription because the price is significantly cheaper, only to find out later that you can ONLY purchase the family account through Lumosity's website or if you purchased it through the App Atore you have to email them to set it up. I emailed them 3 days ago only to get the useless email below;Mis;Positive;Education    
Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to upgrade subscriptions purchased via iTunes, so there is not a way to purchase the Family Plan on your existing subscription.;Mis;Negative;Education    
However, you can purchase a Family Plan when your current subscription ends. If you'd like to start a Family Plan then, you should turn off recurring billing in iTunes so that your current individual subscription won't renew. Then, after your current subscription has ended, you can purchase a Family Plan.;Mis;Positive;Education

Great app but it's not free it costs 50 for a year up front to unlock stuff or 11 month which is more than 120 a year which seems a bit steep to me and I'm sure the premium features are great but for this price I'm not sure it's worth it. Needless to say I am disappointed.;Usa;Neutral;Education    
I dont want to give this 1 star but their feedback webpage seems to be broken so hopefully they see this. First, please fix the feedback page. Second, please improve the controls on penguin pursuit.

Zillow makes it much easier to find out about an area, see pricing, and sort out properties that I can afford from those I cannot. Once I narrow down a selection then I can take the time to go see them. Before that, I am saving tons of time by scouting online first. Sellers don't have to show to someone who really isn't interested, and buyers don't waste their time seeing homes that do not match their description. I also keep an eye on the property values in areas that I already own homes in. It's a great tool for home owners. Everyday I am searching for that perfect lake house. I fully intend to find it on Zillow.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle

I do love looking at the pictures I think the pictures need captions. There does not need to be doubles of the pictures In multiple building sales, I want to know which building I'm looking at I would like to see a floor plan too and a plot plan. In the ranches, when I look at the birds eye view, I want to see where the property is I only want to look homes on a river or an active creek.

I'm amending my favorable review because the functionality has taken a turn for the worse. Specifically, Zestimates swing wildly.  I have received them monthly, and the latest is drastically different than the rest.  The main concern is that the past Zestimates are in line with our neighborhood sales but the latest isn't even close.  Compounding the issue is that past Zestimates are ignored in the historical chart. Another problem is setting Make me Move or For Sale by Owner  they don't work.;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle

Totally inaccurate values.  Neighbors who have done nothing to houses in decades, nothing at all, have gained 30,000 in home values while we, doing many updates in the last 4 years,  have dropped in value in 1 month.  Algorithms absolutely wrong.  Uninstalling.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Every house I see and call about is either sold or in contract. Some of them were sold months ago. It's useless. They send you the same houses over and over and over as new listings. The emails are endless even after you request them to stop and half of them are for areas I have no interest in. I see some that say potential listing What the hell is that It's either for sale or it's not. Glad it was free and even at that price it's not worth it. Someone should also update the overhead view options. I look at houses on my block and some of the pictures are over 5 years old. And taxes Why are they not even close with taxes I have seen houses that say taxes are 8000 but when I speak with the realtor they are actually 15000, that is a pretty big ball park..

Changed the price of a home by almost 40 in less than a couple of months and continues to drop it everyday. Zillow even doesn't check official county's record. It's estimation is much less than the county tax estimation.;Dep;Negative;Lifestyle   
The app is good, except it doesn't allow the owner to pick actual comparable homes. It only allows you to remove suggested homes. In our case it's suggesting homes in a track that are 40 years older than our track. There are numerous homes of the exact same model as mine that have sold or are currently on the market, but the app won't use them. Certainly a bug that needs fixing.;Dep,Usa;Negative;Lifestyle

Zillow is the best app I have used for finding property for sale or rent.  It is full of great information on each property, not to mention excellent photos and or videos.  The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is it does not get updated as frequently as I would have liked.  A few properties I was interested in that was listed were already sold.  The good thing is there are many properties for sale in this app.;Dep;Positive;Lifestyle    
In November my wife's job was relocated from San Juan Capistrano Ca. to Rhode Island. She had to be at her job on Feb 22.

I used to love Zillow. Our first experience two years ago was great, the house was posted right away. This time has been terrible. Four days now and still not posted and no response from customer support except a robot stating they were working on it. After emailing again, no response. We were hoping to have showings this weekend. This has been very frustrating and I would no longer recommend it to anyone trying to list a home. Also our zestimate changed up 100,000.00 in 24 hours, then went back down. Getting homes listed should be more important than zestimates.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Lifestyle

Up until the newest version I would have given Zillow a 5.  I love the functionality, ease of use, etc. However, the update that put take video as the first pic makes no sense at all. Why is this showing in public view As a user, am I going to take a video for the sellers  In addition should you accidentally touch the screen when viewing this new screen instead of swiping you have to turn your phone to landscape mode and then hit cancel in order to escape.  This is so annoying to the point that I no longer want to use the app. I get you are pushing video, which makes sense but that should only show in owner view, right  I own multiple properties and have exclusively used Zillow to buy and list rentals but will probably switch apps because of the annoyance of this video update.

App is convenient and has some nice options but if your an avid user looking seriously for property you will find that house sqft, past sales histories, neighboring home values etc shown are very inaccurate leading to poor information for decisions.

The Aramaic Language is not included in this app. It is something I am trying to learn.;Mis;Neutral;Reference    
This app is basically terrific  a lifesaver when trying to read in a new language. For me, Spanish. The camera feature, which can be used to translate larger amounts of printed matter, has a long way to go. Recently, a new problem has cropped up when typing in a few words of Spanish, suddenly Exp. appears as the translation. This seems to happen mostly with reflexive verbs, but it's hard to tell. That is having a serious adverse effect on the app's usefulness. I hope they will fix it soon.;Usa;Positive;Reference   
Best app I use it often;Mis;Positive;Reference   
I have trouble talking to my Mexican parents and I can't talk to them but with this app I can text them my Christmas wish list in Spanish.;Mis;Positive;Reference

I've been using this app a while now and it's been helping me with learning Chinese. The offline translation feature was really useful for me during my long trip in China. My only issue with the app is that there is no pronunciation offline. This app doesn't work in China unless you use a vpn.;Usa;Positive;Reference   
Still needs to develop some language audio i.e. Arabic and other less commonly accessed languages. Would be nice if there is a possibility of having the native language key board with English keyboard on the app. Some other issues of app freezing but the update seams to have addressed that for the most part.  Would recommend. Overall a very good app that in general outperforms many other apps on the market.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Reference

In my opinion, this app is far better the iTranslate. You gotta pay a subscription to basically use the app. I LOVE the translate photo feature. Thanks Google;Mis;Positive;Reference   
I've been using the English to Chinese translation to help learn certain words and characters, but I've come to notice that direct translations can only get you so far. The differences in grammar and sentence structure for languages prevents any app from seamlessly transforming something from one language to another. Also, you may get a different translation depending on the structure of your input phrase, so make sure that the translation you receive is in the correct tense and word form. ;Dep;Positive;Reference   
Flaws aside, this app does have a really useful feature that allows you to access languages offline through a download as well as save certain wordphrase translations. However, if you save too many different translations, it becomes difficult to manage, as there is no way to organize the translations. They are simply sorted according to the order in which they were saved. It would be extremely helpful to be able to organize them alphabetically or manually.;Usa;Positive;Reference    
A marvelous language survival kit. Excellent convenience with ability to download language for offline translation. Accepts typed and spoken input. Doesn't go crazy with ads and quirks like other translation apps. Love this app;Mis;Positive;Reference   
I use Google Translate a lot, and in the past it's been pretty useful. However, there's room for improvement. ;Mis;Positive;Reference   
First of all, I think there should be a wider variety of languages and dialects. I find it very annoying that I can't translate Certain languages to other certain languages. ;Mis;Negative;Reference    
Second of all, whenever I translate certain foreign words to English, the translation is Wrong. For instance, I've tried multiple times to translate the Bulgarian word '' transliteration Bulgarski, translation Bulgarian to English, it said it meant 'English'. Obviously, something isn't right. And I, several times, have translated 'The Squad Goes out' in English to Hebrew, but the Hebrew translation says 'The Class is Dismissed'. Please fix it. ;Dep;Positive;Reference   
And I've noticed that when I type in 'Deus Vult', which is Latin for 'God Wills', it doesn't translate from Latin. It translates from Portuguese. Fix this.;Dep;Positive;Reference   
It's a great app and It helps me always it's very helpful app ;Mis;Positive;Reference   
So far so good opens a new worlds;Mis;Positive;Reference   
When I speak in German to have it translated to English sometimes I have to think for a second of the word I want but it assumes I'm finished and translates an incomplete sentence. Very annoying. I think they need to put a longer delay on it so it doesn't translate it after 0.5 seconds of silence.  If we spoke a second language perfectly we wouldn't be using the app or needing to pause for a second to think of the word.  An easy fix which many would find very valuable.  Or an even better fix is to have an option to simply turn automatic translation off.  This way when the user is finished heshe can hit translate and voil. ;Usa;Positive;Reference

But CroatianEnglish translations are next to useless. Whether words are entered by text, camera or speech, it tends to give multiple meanings that are completely unrelated to each other and which don't make sense in context, or it offers no translation at all  just a repeat of the word it can't translate. Camera is particularly lame.;Usa;Negative;Reference    
I love this app and use it all the time it's definitely a godsend, but I hate that I can't translate to and from Western Frisian in the app. It's available online but not on the app for some reason, and it would be helpful to have it on the app.;Sup;Positive;Reference   
I have been using this app to write in Russian. I sent a multi paragraph text in both Russian and English to someone who knows both. He said he was shocked at the accuracy. Thanks Google;Mis;Positive;Reference   
I'm using the app and it's pretty good however I have to cross reference almost everything with another translator because the translations are not pure. The biggest issue or words in the English language that do not translate properly over to the Chinese language and vice versa. Four instance silly in Chinese comes across as stupid in English. Obviously things like that could create a misunderstanding.;Dep;Positive;Reference

I would be willing to pay for the app if there is an option for female voices. And if you are trying to improve the app, users should be able to have an option to choose the voice gender.

I really like the whole game. The mechanics work well and the game is smooth and not choppy.

Please read this and consider having it in your game. Thanks;Usa;Positive;Games   
The game so far reminds me of the blue and red versions from the gameboy days, but what is causing problems are the server issues and minor game bugs. And hopefully they add an auto signin option, or a way of saving the login info, aggitating to always signin each time. And when it comes to the raid system, I dislike that you have to use a pass to join a raid, not knowing that there aren't other users, a preview of how many other users joined should be shown. And as for joining a raid, for example if I join a raid for a specific Pokmon, then the gamer should be placed in a lobby system, waiting to be matched with users trying to attack the specific Pokmon as well, no matter what state or country the gamers are playing at...;Dep,Usa;Negative;Games    
Make raids more accessible for rural players not just players in cities. I'm sick of just watching utube videos on people doing raids. I want do them myself but there aren't enough people to do them with. Make the cp of the raid boss dependent on the amount of players.;Usa;Negative;Games    
The new system of gym battles raids is pretty cool. However, I am continuously receiving network error messages when I try to fight gyms the traditional way. This may be a fluke, but it has happened four times in a row now and is very discouraging. Hopefully it gets patched in the near future.;Dep;Negative;Games   
I love the game, but I have a suggestion for a new feature. As the raid bosses are sometimes extremely difficult to beat without a large party size, could you add a feature that allows players to request help on a raid battle Something that would pop up over an active raid battle that tells you there are other trainers nearby waiting to take on the raid boss but need help. This could aid in bringing people together if trainers don't have a large group of friends who also play the game. Thanks, and keep up the good work;Usa;Positive;Games    
Not enough battle mechanics. Prestiging is gone and gyms are WAY too easy. Why can't ALL raids be soloable I've seen several legendary raids with NOBODY around.

It's a very good game even if it's nothing like the Pokmon series. It's additive and gets you outside. I mean, I visited places I never knew were a thing in my town because of Pokmon GO. There's a few bugs with the nearby list, but overall it's a five star game. ;Usa;Positive;Games  
Gym coins are horrible you should get more than 50 a day. If you have a crap load of gyms taken over, and you worked hard you deserve to get all the coins for the time they are in. So once they come back you should get the 50 for that hour, and if it's been two days then a limit should be per Pokmon. So say one Pokmon is in a gym, that Pokmon should be limited to so much a day once it's returned, but it there shouldn't be a limit on all per day. You should be able to get 50 per Pokmon in each gym a day. So for ex. If I have 3 Pokmon in a gym for one hour it's 150 coins, so if 1 Pokmon is in a gym for a whole day the max coins should be like 50 to 100 per Pokmon so we aren't losing our effort, and time on gyms.;Mis;Positive;Games    
Sup Niantic. So I love your game to bits and pieces but I live in Arizona where in the summer it's about 200 degrees everyday.

Pokmon go is decent game... but there things that I think most people will like. First they should add to egg incubators when you spin the poke stop same thing with lure module. Sorry my spelling is bad just try to sound it out anyway.... also they should Trading, ugh Pokmon will be a lot better with trading but I think that they didn't do trading because people can find a way to steal other people Pokmon blah blah blah also I think they didn't start trading because I can be a level 1 and have A dragoinite, charizard, snorlax others too well 2 legendary Pokmon I heard rumors saying 3 legendary birds are coming out anyway thank you for reading this I really appreciate it Pokmon please read this.;Sup;Positive;Games    
I love how when I try to see if there's any legendary Pokmon I hit up my friends on social media and we get there and there's a ton of people there ready to catch it and we all work together to do so, I love it The only thing that could make the game better if more Pokmon from other gens were added PS.

You've proven time and again, especially recently, that you do not care about rural players or even players with disabilities who cannot get out and about to go Pokmon hunting. For those of us who have few gyms or even stops around us, seeing legendaries is a pipe dream. Defeating and capturing a legendary when you have no one to help you is a waste of time and disappointing. ;Usa;Negative;Games    
The last straw for me was today. We finally, FINALLY saw a legendary raid battle. Articuno. My son was shocked and thrilled and begged me to try for it with him. I did it even though I knew it wouldn't end well. Only three people battling a legendary is doomed to fail. It didn't end well and my son was extremely sad afterward. ;Mis;Negative;Games

It's been a year since my first review and it's still impossible to track Pokemon within the game. Worse yet, garbage Pokemon still hold priority on the nearby list. I was two feet away from a Snorlax the other day and fortunately I stumbled onto it because the only Pokemon on my nearby were Spinarak and Pidgey. I'm not even in a super rural area, so I can't imagine how awful it still is for players out in the country. Since raids were introduced, my app has crashed literally hundreds of times over a 23 week span, so Ill update this review yet again when I can assess how this recent patch fixes crashes on iPhone 6. Obviously the game is enjoyable considering I've been playing since launch, but it's disappointing to look back and see that in all that time Niantic still hasn't fixed a number of obvious flaws within the game. I would love to see a The Pokemon Company buy out, but consider how much money Niantic is raking in, I don't think that's likely any time soon.;Dep,Usa;Neutral;Games

Great App overall developers, I have one small thing that you could fix to improve this app, the app has access to both the user's age and location, and thus so has the capability to know if the user can legally drive. I can't legally drive or even get my temps yet and it is slightly annoying that I am frequently asked if I am driving or if I'm a passenger while I'm playing Pokmon go in the car.

UPDATE After adding legendary raids.. it has been a disaster. Even though I live in a well populated city.. you need 15 players just to take down an Articuno.. the only one time we succeeded.. no capture. So if you're looking for a real disappointment then by all means give this game a shot;Mis;Negative;Games    
It's hard enough getting 5 people to a raid even downtown in a city. I've done 8 legendary raids, and haven't caught any of them. The 23 catch rate devastating, and has taken the fun out of the game. Now that I've missed my chance at an Articuno, I'm not sure I want to keep playing.;Mis;Negative;Games    
We had 13 people for a Lugia raid. Beat lugia in battle and the game locked up for all of the players. Nobody was able to capture because our games all froze once Lugia was in the ball. We all wasted Raid passes;Dep;Negative;Games   
I have been playing this game since July of last year. I have been patiently waiting for the release of the legendary Pokmon. I don't know that many people who play the game and I live outside of town. I was finally able to find a place with a lot of people and beat 3 Articunos today, but I did not capture a single one. I even purchased additional raid passes. This is a horrible way to reward your long term players Nitanic I think I am done playing this game if they are going to make this difficult to catch legendary Pokmon.;Mis;Negative;Games

Player communication is mind boggling missing between the developers and the community. Things can not work, but not acknowledging it makes it so much worse.

Forgot not to use your app on a bus or in a car, that notification pops up so much I lost a few great balls when Eevee ran away behind that notification. It should only pop up once... Anyway, your updates ruined this. Too much fee to play trash, not enough rewards for playing. You should give 10 pokeballs away per daily login. Thats what other games I play regularly do.

I enjoy catching the Pokmon with my Hubby and kids. I'm not big on the battles and fights I like collecting the Pokmon. I wish I could connect my account to my husbands andor other people in the area where we can meet as characters in the game and not just fight but trade Pokmon with each other. I want to try and catch them all and if we could trade Pokmon I would have a higher chance. Also you can make it possible to do personal raids where you can either trade or fight the person you run into. Just like the show where Ash meets new friends andor enemies. Makes the game seem more...real to see nearby Pokmon goers through the app to friend or fight. Also I live in the middle of the woods and I can walk all day in my neighborhood but we have no Pokmon in our area... we have to drive to town to catch them  so please try and expand your Pokmon areas to even places like the middle of the back woods of Alabama  Other than that I enjoy the game very much ;Usa;Positive;Games    
So I failed to catch 2 articunos at the moment but now they are being removed Like seriously Don't remove them;Mis;Neutral;Games    
the companion app for the Apple Watch does not work, it shows only when Pokmon are near by and does not count the steps you have made.;Dep,Sup;Neutral;Games   
Love it so much I have 10 legendary Pokmon already;Mis;Positive;Games   
I've tried so very hard with this game. I've accepted the bugs, glitches, even the fact this is barely a game to begin with. I live out in the middle of nowhere, so I drove great distances to play this game. I even went to that festival in Chicago. ;Mis;Positive;Games   
But I can't do it anymore. This game is broken, it's almost as broken as it was on day one. This game is NOT fun. The raids are a greedy cash grab and do not work half the time. So you could buy a raid pass, beat a raid, and then get NOTHING;Dep;Negative;Games   
This game is a waste of time, a waste of money, and a worst of all this is a waste of your life.;Mis;Negative;Games    
This is by far my favorite app in the App Store and I love the  idea of raids. But there are a few problems that I want you to understand. For 1 it would be a good idea so when you click on a raid you could see how many people were there BEFORE you put in a raid pass. For 2 it would be a good idea to nerf legendary raids so they are easier to defeat because me and 10 people  all above level 27 went against an articuno and we could not defeat it, it always ended up ending up in the red. Plus I have heard of some people defeating a raid and losing anyway because they defeated it at the end of the timer and it takes to long for the raid Pokmon to shrink. So either ditch the shrinking animation or having the timer STOP when defeating it. I hope you read this and I hope you have a nice day person reading this now I shall be gone.;Dep;Positive;Games    
I have seriously been beating gyms today for hours just so I can put pokemons there and get pokecoins to get raid passes. The last 5 pokemons I have put in have been in gyms for at least 23 hours each But come to find out when I check the store I have not received a single pokecoin. What's the whole point of me spending this time on the game if I'm not going to get my rewards and spend it on raid passes Ridiculous;Mis;Negative;Games    
One of the worst games I've played. I love Pokemon but this is just a HORRIBLE game. Every time I try to catch a Pokemon my game crashes and when I get back the game says Oh you were in a Dangerous Area or Don't play Pokemon GO while driving. When I'm not even in a car nor train or any sort of a automobile and I'm in a public area in a safe area too. The game makes me lose battery x20 faster even with battery saver and low brightness. You'll more likely not going to get hit if you stay in safe areas. I hate this game and it deservers a Bad Rating.;Dep;Negative;Games   
I was having a really fun time playing and I was really excited when I heard legendaries were coming, the only legendary I really wanted was Articuno, I had no idea about the two week time limit. In fact, I only found out about it after the last day I could have possibly caught an Articuno. It's unfair that you reward the team that won the competition by giving them two weeks to catch their legendary bird, while giving the other birds an entire month, and then deleting them from the game forever If you bring them back, I'll change my rating.;Mis;Positive;Games    
It would be nice if you bring them back after Zapdos is release just with a lower capture rate maybe 10.5 than the other legendaries, I would even be fine if you did these challenges every year or maybe even twice a year, but having the wining team's bird appear for two weeks and then having it never show up again, not cool, Niantic;Mis;Negative;Games    
I saw lots of Articuno raids, but every single time, I was either busy or in a car. You need to think about what people are doing even in summer, it's not like everyone is magically free from everything for a while.;Mis;Positive;Games

I work right next door to a gym but for some reason when I want to battle the gym the gps on the game makes my guy walk like 3 miles away from my current location. So I can never fight at a gym or when I am fighting it the guy walks away from the gym.;Mis;Positive;Games   
I play everyday with my friends and haven't stopped since it first came out. Especially with legendary raids, we go to every gym and play for hours on end.;Dep;Positive;Games   
It doesn't let me log in from my google account and you can't get a legendary with out pay 25 for them and you sill might not get one and you don't get much game need Pokmon senter and poke shop and you Pokmon and battle wild Pokmon and when you level up you need more comin Pokmon like when your a high enough level legendarys show up still there rarely will show up and you can buy your level or Ern them but when you a high level like 50 it take a long time to level up then the game will be fun but it's bad not fun boring arster 25 mothes;Sup;Positive;Games    
The new update basically turns off catchable pokemon the moment you move around, I guess its to stop people from driving around but literally if you're not standing still, nothing is available. I used to enjoy on hikes but now if I want to catch anything, I have to stop and stand still. Make a playable game out of this or fck off;Usa;Positive;Games

I love the game don't get me wrong but I am at a hotel in a city I don't know very well and there are cool Pokemon everywhere. But there are no pokestops nearby so I ran out of pokeballs. The next time I turned on the gamewhen I was out of pokeballsthere was my favorite Pokemon standing there and I didn't have any pokeballs to capture it.;Mis;Positive;Games    
So fun game overall but they should make something like a daily reward to help get you pokeballswe can't always go out;Mis;Positive;Games    
I didn't even get past the loading screen because every time I tried to open this app, it just closed by itself and didn't let me play;Dep;Negative;Games   
Still can't get it right.  Legendaries would have been great, except people got left out with stats like prizeraid ratio 016.  That isn't 16 balls. That's 16 battles with anywhere from 512 balls per raid and came up with N O T H I N G  Challenge is great, impossible with a huge cost of time, money, travel, getting groups together and after 16 raids absolutely zero to show for it...NO ARTICUNO, NO LUGIA.  justdone;Mis;Positive;Games    
I love this game but I can't even play it because it crashes every 10 seconds And I don't feel like niantic is doing anything about it. I never had this problem before;Dep;Negative;Games   
In the last three days I have ridden 27.23 MILES on my bike. I have only accrued 4.08 kilometers toward my eggs. The app is designed to get people up and moving. Walking should not be the only tracks le movement. I have written about this in the past and nothing is being done about it. I now know it's not my phone because I've been using a secondary tracking app and it works just fine. My average riding speed is 8.2 mph so it's nowhere near the average speed of a car. I should have hatched every egg in my bag by now. Instead, I haven't hatched a single one. I will continue to lower my rating of this game until it's fixed;Dep,Usa;Negative;Games

I do not had a license or permit so when I am in the car I would like to be able to still catch Pokmon. This is a kid friendly game so I think you should be able to catch them on the go. Hence the name Pokmon go. Please make it so you can catch them when you are driving;Usa;Positive;Games

Lacks support for players outside of a major population center. I live in Las Vegas, NV about 30 minutes from the all too popular strip. Most of the pokestops in town are at the strip or shopping malls. If you visit your local park you might have 13 pokestops. Is this game designed for people to travel by car to a high traffic area just to play That would be this games down fall. ;Sup,Usa;Positive;Games    
I don't mind walking around my neighborhood for several blocks but there's no point without pokestops. Seems the only way to get poke balls is to buy them or drive to a park everyday and spend 34 hours spinning stops for a chance of getting balls. People don't want to be strong armed into buying something. Update your map with more pokestops;Usa;Positive;Games    
You know it's come a long way. Only complaint is lack of candy. I'd play the game more of it wasn't 3 miles for a single candy to evolve my guys.;Usa;Negative;Games

I honestly really love the game and can Tell you guys are working hard on improving it I feel like if you try to bring back prayers you shouldn't focus on new generations you should focus on features like trading or pvp;Mis;Positive;Games   
Pokmon go, is an awesome game, but apparently Niantic isn't very concerned about how many people play their game because of the recent updates. All this began when the time for Pokmon to spawn was changed from 5 to 10. Not a big deal, it was still fun and promoted walking. Then, there was a small grace period before they released their second fatal  update. They scrapped their tracking system. SERIOUSLY THEY REMOVED THE ONLY WAY TO FIND POKMON ACCURATELY That also removed all third party scanners, which literally was the only reason most of the players actually went to catch Pokmon. But more advanced trackers like FPM survived. Then they killed any form of hope by adding a captcha robot detector feature. Which removed all the advanced third party scanners. Being able to actually know where the Pokmon I wanted to catch were was the only reason I played Pokmon go. But I still played for a while by riding my bike and running certain trails. But then, the final straw was when Pokmon ceased to appear if you walked, ran or biked too fast. Now, all I can do in Pokmon go is walk around at the speed of Old man to catch a pidgey or two. Or if I'm lucky, a rare and elusive rattata. That's how much I care at this point. Pokmon go lost like 90 of its players because of Niantic's wrong decisions. Also, seriously, the buddy system is is complete and total garbage. Let me walk 5km to get 1 candy for my eevee And don't forget about Pokmon go's high end nearby tracking system. Which is completely broken. There was a koffing on the last slot which means it was the farthest away and suddenly it appears right in front of me. All in all, I don't think Niantic even cares about this game anymore. They removed key features and made the game unplayable.;Sup,Usa;Positive;Games    
prepare to be the very best like no one ever was, because they are throwing out all that made Pokmon interesting and keeping the part where you walk back and forth in the grass until something happens;Mis;Positive;Games

UPDATE 2 CRAP TRACKING;Dep;Negative;Games   
Once again you let us down, we were thinking big, Trading BATTLING LEGENDARIES Some even went as far as to say GEN II. But instead of all that you bring us... The removing of tracking for rural areas... and a few measly, useless, baby Pokmon. And the worst of all, though old news you can't collect pokestops while riding to school, or going to the mall in an uber.;Sup;Negative;Games    
Thanks for adding expensive boxes that are only accessible to people that beat gyms every day since Pokmon go came out. ;Mis;Positive;Games    
UPDATE 2.6 I've had an epiphany. ;Mis;Neutral;Games    
Even though it was pretty obvious, This game had the potential to stay in the top 5 grossing, because they are using a franchise most people would love, they had the opportunity to implement many features that could have made the game SOOOOO much better, they had the resources, but they didn't have the skill... ;Mis;Positive;Games    
Out of all the app companies... out of all the great app developers... They had to choose the most incompetent, most useless and crummy app developing company... Niantic. they have only had two apps before Pokmon go  Ingress  which I have to say, most people like it but it still looks pretty crummy and poorly made. And that other nature walk one I don't even want to talk about. All in all, we have to face the facts...  Niantic is incompetent;Mis;Neutral;Games    
It's too late Incompetent Niantic, your game is DEAD and there's no saving it. At magic kingdom where there are supposed to be a TON of people that play pokemon go, but there are only venonats and garbage like that. No matter what you do to try to revive this game, it's already over, you are done, THIS GAME IS DEAD, even my diehard pokemon go friend is starting to quit, no one even remembers this game anymore.;Mis;Negative;Games

I love Pokmon. I always have and always will. My single complaint, is that the app shuts down when it's in the background. Which completely ruins the purpose of the go plus.;Dep;Neutral;Games

There should really be more pokestops and gyms here I live close to the woods and I never have any pokeballs or poke coins;Mis;Neutral;Games    
I wanted to give this app one star because I have played it before on my friends iPhone 7 and I only have a iPhone 4s so when I got the game he got me set up to were I can finish the tutorial and when I tried to tap the charamander it crashes so when this is fixed for the older iPhones I will give this app a better review.;Dep;Positive;Games   
This game does not workout iPad Have tried everything to make it work but never does. If anybody has any advice let me know;Sup;Neutral;Games    
THE HEALTH DROP RATE IN GYMS IS RIDICULOUS  I put a Pokmon in a gym at 940am and it's now 910pm same day and it's a 1 hit knock out now.  That is stupidly fast.  Everyone though pokemon with 3000cp were the error pokemon so why oh why did you continue with that course of action.  ARE YOU LISTENING NIANTIC;Mis;Negative;Games    
Fix the spoofer problem.  The game is no longer fun.  You took a broken system and made it worse.  It's WAY easier for spoofers to control gyms.;Mis;Negative;Games   
Also, you made stardust impossible to collect without just catching pokemon.  I used to have the potential to get 5000 stardust a day for having pokemon in gyms.  Now I get that by feeding Pokmon berries.  How many do you say  250 Pokmon.  I have to feed 250 Pokmon a day to get that same bonus.  Or catch 100 Pokmon.  Who has time to do the work to do that;Usa;Positive;Games    
I have been playing Pokmon Go since release, me while I am a huge fan, I need Niantic to get their act together and help out us rural players. I am going to list out all of the things wrong with rural playing, and give pointers on how to fix.;Usa;Positive;Games    
First of all, spawns are an absolute joke out in rural areas. Since then you have increased spawn rates, however all that has accomplished is increase the amount of crappy Pokmon that I come across. Please Niantic, increase RARER spawns, because even a rock or fire Pokmon gets me excited at this point.;Mis;Positive;Games    
Second of all, while the new gym system is MUCH improved from the older system, it still has its flaws. The first is the 50 coin max, as the limited gyms in these areas are always changing hands. That way, is you hold a gym for longer it's really an accomplishment OUT in rural areas, yet no real reward is given. The other thing that needs to be changed is less about rural areas, but if more then one Pokmon get knocked out in the same day, only the first rewards coins. This feature is absolutely ABSURD considering we still worked to get those other gyms, yet get no reward. ;Mis;Positive;Games    
The third feature that needs changing is raids. I love the feature, as it has already helped me to get several new Pokmon. HOWEVER, in rural areas, good raids are far and few between. So when I find something like a Snorlax or Tyranitar raid I get really excited. That's all well in good, except for the fact that their cp is too high to beat without any other players nearby, remember that rural thing so I have never beaten ANY OF THEM Still don't have A Tyranitar;Mis;Positive;Games    
The fourth is being led into by my third, and that is the new legendary raids. Legendaries have been hyped up ever since the game came out, and not only am I sorely disappointed but I will never get one. Again, good raids are far and few between, so finding a legendary raid is hard enough. Then I can never beat one because there are no players that play near me to help with the raid. And say that for some reason I actually do complete a raid which I won't then the catch rate is THREE PERCENT To make it fairer, I think they should do two things. One of which is a suggestion and the other is something that absolutely needs to happen. I think a good idea would be that the legendary raid cp should not be a determined thing, and should be created by the amount of people who are in the actual raid. That way it would still be really hard, but not impossible for rural players to complete. The other thing that needs to be implemented is the increasing catch rate of legendaries to at least 15 considering beating them is hard enough. Maybe they could also have an event where all of the already released legendaries are put in raids and their cp cut in half if they don't do the auto scaling cp.;Mis;Positive;Games    
Again, I love the game but they need to better scale it towards rural players just as much people in the cities. Please    recomment any of my suggestions that you find fitting so Niantic can see;Mis;Positive;Games    
Network issues kept popping up like had full connection and everything but the poke stop I was trying to capture kept bugging out. I want my rewards because that was bogus.;Dep;Positive;Games   
Pokmon Go continues to frustrate.  Constant crashing and glitching which get REALLY bad if you share a connection. Fix asap;Dep;Negative;Games   
There are games on iOS that are much more complex logically and graphically with a fraction of the issues  this is simply poor coding on the part of Niantic.  The good news is there have been many updates , the bad news is the problems continue.  This app needs bug fixes over features right now.;Mis;Negative;Games

This game is fun and addictive, but it constantly crashes and heats up my phone after maybe 46 minutes of use. If I get through a gym battle it's a miracle, since the game especially lags when you try to interact with them. Seems like this latest update is worse about it than ever.;Dep;Negative;Games   
pokemon gets knocked out of gym and I don't get anything from it feel like iv wasted my time putting them in gyms now...... and what is the deal with it unfavorating my pokemon after i put them in a gym ... i would still love to be able to add people i know as friends and see them on my map with my buddy im walking, the map is too lonely... plus if you could have friends you could do some trading and that would be awesome;Usa;Positive;Games

The game was amazing until all the errors and bugs that kick me out of every gym battle. Guess I'm just going to keep catching Pokmon;Dep;Negative;Games   
I love this game. I have been playing ever since the release, and have enjoyed every minute of it. I am also enjoying this new update, and finally getting to battle and catch legendary pokemon. I just have one bug to address. Whenever I put a favorited pokemon into a gym, it loses its favorite star after it has been kicked out. Thank you for reading my review and I hope you fix this bug. Otherwise, still a fantastic game;Dep;Positive;Games  
Suggestion The new gym system took a lot of stardust out of the game. We need more stardust There would be a better balance between stardust and candy if we got 200 stardust for evolving each Pokmon.;Mis;Positive;Games    
I'm new to Pokmon and I'm a grownup. I love it So cute and fun, and really rewards you for walking. It's practically a fitness app. The special events add to the fun, and the new gym system and raid battles are great for getting all teams and levels to work together. Thank you;Mis;Positive;Games   
The best game. A good family game.;Mis;Positive;Games   
Pokmon Go is notorious for its overabundance of Pidgeys, Ratattas, Weedles, Venonats, Sentrets, and Spinaraks.  The game alerts players as to which types of Pokmon can be found in the wild at a given time and place, some of which are such rare spawns you hardly get to find them anywhere else.  Every single time, I'm let down by the Nearby list because my radar is flooded with these overabundant Pokmon I've listed above instead of the spawns the list had promised.;Usa;Negative;Games    
The only way to make progress in Pokmon Go is to catch several, sometimes hundreds, of duplicates of the same species of Pokmon to gain Candies, Stardust, and EXP.  But if all but 10 species are readily accessible to catch in the wild, there's no ability for users to catch different species andor make them stronger.;Mis;Positive;Games    
I propose that the Pokmon on the Nearby list should spawn in the wild predictably and promisingly.  I cannot count how many times the silhouette of a somewhat rare Pokmon has appeared on the list and have been lost to the abyss that is random spawning.  Please make this happen, Niantic.  Us in the suburbs cannot walk casually from interesting place to interesting place as you could in the city.;Usa;Positive;Games    
They put raids great idea but they cost raid things and they are just milking the money out of us they need to take out raid passes;Mis;Positive;Games    
I appreciate the effort that has gone into this game but at the same time it still needs to be better. the game has decent stability over all but i still find my device crashing often. the pokestop speed lock is absolutely rediculous. riding a bicycle in a pokemon game was half the game and your speed lock is so low it effects my bike. fix that. There probably should also be a daily rewards page not some dumb temporary pop up. last but not least after the pokemon fest failure i would think the devs are gonna actually take the time to figure out if the game is even gonna work instead of focusing on a quick buck i swear the only link that works perfect is the poke coin special boxes lol. pvp and trading needs to be added to this game immediately or your gonna lose a huge player base. trust me i know. your legendary raids have been a headache and people want something that will be an enjoyment. player vs player battles. please stop putting this off and ill give better review.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Games    
It's an amazing game but I want to see other people on my map and be able to request to battle them like friends or random people. Also I want to be able to trade Pokmon with my friends. Lastly I don't care if this happen but a suggestion maybe add pokefarms where u can catch Pokmon and grow candy.;Usa;Positive;Games   
...but I just can't. PvP is the only thing that will ever make me want to play this game again;Mis;Positive;Games    
I fought an articuno raid and won the group I was with got to fight it but I didn't. I didn't even get the awards for beating it and I would at least like a response from you that you acknowledge this please it's very frustrating that I don't even get the experience;Dep;Positive;Games   
Why waste my life going to gyms to take them fairly when some lazy idiot can just gain remote access and boot me right after This is something you should have worked on fixing long ago so that gameplay is fair for everyone.;Mis;Negative;Games    
This app has me more motivated than ever with my exercise, especially now with the raids. Kudos.;Mis;Positive;Games   
It was a good ride but this game has lost all its luster. Legendaries are buggy at best gym rework is horrendous way better and more lucrative before. The PVP is still nowhere to be found as are the rest of the shiny Pokmon. Chicagos event was a disaster at best the refund for traveling was a joke and it's been the same constant problem the servers. I've tried to overlook everything and I must say I've truly TRIED but this last hiccup was my last. Never thought I'd uninstall this one but sadly the day has come nowhere near as fun as it was upon release and I don't see it getting any better.;Dep;Positive;Games

I really love this game, I do, it's sort of doing what every kid would have been wanting to do while watching the tv series, but there are some problems that can be solved.;Mis;Positive;Games    
 In raid battles, once the group has come together to defeat a legendary, why don't you give the trainers a higher percentage on catching them It doesn't even have to be 100, at least 6080  is good enough. It's already difficult gathering a team and fighting a tough boss, but why is the outcome which should be the reward for the hard effort so much more difficult The trainer loses the legendary and all the effort has gone to waste. Please do something about this, I believe this would be a great improvement for this game, and many others would believe the same too.;Mis;Positive;Games    
I've recently been playing the game but the new update for the gyms is very glitchy. I've put in 7 Pokmon into a gym over the past day and I've only gotten coins for two of them. I would get the notification saying the Pokmon has Returned but I wouldn't get the coins. I've made over 200 coins but have only revived 30 of them. I've also noticed that the legendary Pokmon are not able to be put in gyms which I think it is ridiculous.;Dep;Negative;Games   
I love some of the changes the folks at niantic have made to the game. Raid battles, gym play, and look forward to some of the things they have in store. One change I'd like to see is get rid of the 50 coin limit per day. I like that you now earn more cions for being in a gym the longer you are there however, it is very discouraging to have pokemon after pokemon return home with nothing to show. Sometimes they will return just before midnight and leave me with no one left to guard. Raise limit back to 100 per day and make the limit a weekly limit rather then a daily ;Usa;Positive;Games    
Also fix my settings to my account. Each time I login to my accout I have to turn off sounds and music and turn on battery saver but not my pokemon go plus. Let me change accounts and keep my sertings;Per,Usa;Neutral;Games

It takes me ro where im supposed to catch my first Pokmon but i tap on the Pokmon and it doesn't do anything i tap on the catch Pokmon button but it still doesn't do anything it doesn't tell or show me how to do anything it doesn't work i was really looking forward to this game ;Usa;Neutral;Games

I loved this game. The issue was that i had an ipod. I couldnt visit pokestops or gyms if there wasnt free wifi there. I ran out of pokeballs and had to use a new account. Then for my birthday i got a handme down phone. Its an iphone 4 and i was so happy to get to visit pokestops. Then i found out the game wasnt compatable with my phone. Please update it and make it so I love this game and want to play it more but i just CANT.;Sup;Positive;Games    
Well, I'm close to being done playing again. I, like others, am a solo player and with the new raids are shut out of the legendary Pokemon. I cannot win a raid against a legendary by myself. I don't have a group I can call and not enough people show up. How about a 50km legendary egg for solo players can get them I have all Pokemon I can catch except unown and Miltank. I have walked everything. Many kilometers. I paid for incubators and that's it. Now I have to pay more for raids Nope, I'm done. You've excluded me and others like me, solo players and rural players. It's turning into a pay to win game. I do like this game but now I have no reason to play I'm glad you're making money, it's great. But don't lose what the game is about, gotta catch them all, not pay for them all.;Usa;Positive;Games    
It's not fun anymore.;Mis;Negative;Games

I've played this game for 1 Year I have almost every Pokmon Out There So Far Except Lugia,Artacuno,Smoochms but still I'm on the hunt The best game I've ever played was Minecraft The only thing Pokemon Go needs is gen,3,4,5,6,7 It's would be super cool to see a Solgaleo;Mis;Positive;Games

This game Is great don't get me wrong but legendary raids are so screwed up I have beat the only two that I've seen that people have shown up at and I couldn't catch it and as I write this review I'm waiting for another no one near me shows up to these making it basically impossible and the people who did show up already have one now it's the last day for articuno and I still don't have one so that's why you get a 1star;Dep;Negative;Games   
I was fighting a Articuno with a few friends and we beat it I was so excited but right before we Beat it my Pokmon died and I click to rejoin but it said network error and then I close my app and open it back up and it did not give me a chance to catch it.;Dep;Negative;Games   
This game tells me that I'm going too fast on foot, running, walking, even standing still Would be great if I could have it on my bike which I bought a mount for this specific purpose. So why make the I'm a passenger option break all functions Shouldn't passengers be allowed to play while the driver drives Get the liability button out of the way ONCE on application start, then LEAVE ME ALONE. It's a game centered around moving around, that forces you to move at less than 2mph to play. How absurd. Even so this is only the 2nd worst problem with this sleazy cash grab masquerading as a children's game. ;Usa;Negative;Games    
The first being straight up lack of support. Tried on every flagship device of 2017 as well as a few other iPhone and various android devices. ALL of them have bugs far too often for a game of this size. I might spend upwards of 3 for a difficult capture and if the game decides to go awry, I've lost my money. No compensation, apology or desire to fix the app. It's a shame such a beloved brand lent its name to such incompetent developers with their endless greed. Will keep checking up on this one. Review is accurate to 73017;Sup;Negative;Games   
Wanna like the game but most of the time when I play I'm a passenger in a car cuz I have no friends and I can't collect things from pokemarts in a car so fix it and I'll love this game;Usa;Positive;Games    
Pokmon go used to be fun, I played every day, but the recent update to speed up Pokmon decay rate is bad, the level 20 players can easily beat a level 40 player, so what's the point of leveling up Also, you need so many players to beat the legendary Pokmon, it's not so easy and often a waste of time try ing to find enough players;Mis;Negative;Games    
I haven't played it and i know it gets people in danger.i think people shouldn't play it;Mis;Negative;Games    
Was doing a raid just before it ended. Game crashed several times and then I didn't even get the chance to catch due to a crash as the raid had ended timewise and couldn't get back in. With no way to report the issue and nobody that cares. Bad review it is.;Dep;Negative;Games   
With its near constant crashing, it doesn't matter how well any of the other features work, because the vast majority of your time is spent rebooting after a crash. In the middle of catching a Pokmon Crash. Almost hatched a 10 km egg Crash. Mid battle Crash. This game is relentlessly frustrating and the rewards don't even begin to make up for it.;Dep;Negative;Games

Experienced player  level 35 Do not play this game  seriously. It used to be decently fun before the most recent update and now it is just a money grab. The new update has destroyed the competition and reward that the game used to have, it still has concerning bugs that can cause you to waste money, and the developers seem to only care about how much money they can extract from us. I wrote to Niantic to tell them I'd like a refund after a bug that resulted in me wasting my money  of course I get no response. This game is a complete waste of time and money and I urge you to take my word for it. It is a failing game and unfortunately I don't see it being fixed anytime soon. Time to wait for runescape mobile to come out;Dep;Negative;Games

As we entered PoGO, the system was janky, but wonderful Niantic stripped basic features and promised improvements in the future. The tracker used to list every pokemon within a 300yard radius. It was fantastic. Before that, it was EVEN BETTER. There were these little steps that told you how close you were to a pokemon. But then Niantic stripped all these features in leu of showing one pokemon that might be near a certain pokestop. And around when they implemented that they also added promoted pokestops at stores like sprint and starbucks. To top it off Trading and person versus person battles were promised at onset and never introduced. ;Mis;Positive;Games

Ok, this app glitches like crazy and this has a effect on how much of this game I play because I haven't even caught my first Pokmon yet Everything including me and the Pokmon are bunched up in the middle of the screen. Please fix this because I really want to play this game;Dep,Usa;Positive;Games   
This is one of the buggiest games I have ever played. Even from the beginning it crashed all the time. Then there was the 3step glitch that took literally 6 months to fix, and all the features like trading and PvP that are STILL not in the game. And on top of that, it is probably a spying tool. It used to ask for FULL ACCESS to your Google account and it asks for constant location, camera, and even more on Android. Google Bryan Lunduke Pokmon GO for more info about this.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Games

Ive updated and now when I walk my avatar doesnt move nor does the app seem able to handle the gps location of players.

This was an amazing game and I really enjoyed it but issue after issue piled up and Niantic does near nothing about the issues unless it affects paying for items. Game crashes consistently and has been doing so since the launch. Now the PoGo Plus has a bug that makes it next to impossible to use it unless you are standing still with your fingers crossed. Report things all you want but the bottom line is unless it affects profits they will do nothing to fix it. Hey, the people with the Plus already bought it so screw them, right;Dep,Per;Positive;Games   
It would be great to use the GoPlus without the app closing in the background or having the app crash all together. More often than not, whenever I go to check my badges the app will crash. Crash crash crash.;Dep,Usa;Negative;Games   
I love this game I play it everyday. Before work, at work, after work, when i get home. My daughter and I try to see who can get the most stops in one day. However, with the newest update I am extremely disappointed. I am constantly multitasking so I bounce between apps regularly and the new update restarts the game when you leave the app. This makes it incredibly difficult to be able to play as often as I was before.

i am an experienced digital drawer, and i do love this app as it is very easy to use. but there needs to be more tools and things. like a fill bucket, and a symmetry tool, which have made my drawing more frustrating not having access to. it is almost perfect, but needs some more features;Mis;Positive;Entertainment    
So far the best and easiest to learn.  Powerful, but intuitive;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

I absolutely love this app, I'm very new to digital painting and drawing on my tablet but this app paired with the Apple Pencil makes it look like any of my drawings would and makes shading easier for me My only suggestion is the live video section, I like to stream via twitch and have never live streamed in the creative section and wish this app had twitch compatibility It would be super easy to protect my personal accounts ie Facebook and twitter if I could twitch stream it rather than having to post a periscope link or a Facebook link Thank you;Dep;Positive;Entertainment

Im an architectural illustrator and often find myself switching back and forth between this app and Concepts. This app absolutely needs tools for serious professionals. It needs a straight edge, ellipse, rectangle, and text tools. Nearly all other competition has these tools, even MS Paint. The brushes and interface is all top notch. I also would like to see layer groups If this is hidden in the app I havent discovered it. and workspaces.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

Just add the shape tools. Maybe other tools. But really just shape tools please.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment    
I've been using this app for over a year and I've made a lot of great art with it. There are so many different brushes you can create your own too and its design makes it simple to use and figure out The only complaint I have is that every once in a while, it crashes, but closing out of it and opening it again fixes the problem. I also don't think there are shape options, so you can't make an easy circle for backgrounds, or maybe I'm just too stupid to figure it out. Anyways, I've downloaded many drawing apps and this one is by far my favorite Awesome layout, amazing brush and canvas options, and it comes with tutorials and premade color palettes. You can also create your own color palettes and the options are endless. 1010;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
I don't know if it's the pen or the application, but I am using a bamboo sketch and it is not working, at all. It keeps thinking my hand is the stylus and keeps undoing before I even touch the tablet with it. Otherwise, UI and pressure work great, gestures DO NOT.;Usa;Positive;Entertainment

Thanks for the gallery content clean up.  Dragging work to one another is cool. The grouping system helps keep files well organized, it would be nice to have more organization within the grouped file itself.  Even though you have a file, that file can have different folders for different parts.  Still love this app, its the main one I use.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
I have been waiting, not so patiently, for the Apple to produce hardware that matches the creative function of Procreate the new 10.5 Pro and Pencil combined with Procreate gives me the ability to draw as I would in my Molskin using a mechanical pencil. And then merge into a digital format Large pixel size allows seamless integration interface with Photoshop. Because my work is both digital and print I have tremndous latitude for creation  any where I want  most recently at 35,000 feet over the Grand Canyon. As a professor my students know and witness the importance of staying current and Procreate is up to producing high quality design work. Other apps are behind, in terms of intuitive use, features and exporting possibilities. Bravo;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Handsdown the best app for the Apple Pencil and iPad Pro. It can seem intimidating at first, but there are plenty of online resources to help you learn, and once you have a basic understanding of how to use it, you'll start creating amazing artwork. Plus, there's always another fantastic feature to discover. If you have an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil, Procreate is a mustdownload app.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
I get that the developers of this app position it mostly as a drawing app, however, some useful tools like text tool, or just rectangle, just some standard things that almost every drawing app has by now are missing here. And seems like they are nowhere to be find in the near future, which is a bit frustrating.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment    
This app is virtually flawless  and the only thing keeping it from being my go to drawing tool is the lack of additional technical tools. Give me a ruler, give me an ellipse guide, give me a rectangle tool. This is the one area that apps such as Sketchbook Pro really shine  it has great art tools, and great tools that support the art tools. Procreate has exceptional art tools, but lacks any additional tools to support those art tools  and in my opinion, this is what causes Procreate to fall a bit short. The addition of the new draw assist tool in SBP was a total game changer  being able to ink panels on the fly and illustrate flawless ellipses, lines, squares, etc has made that app PERFECT for both rapid concepting and professional production level art. Procreate will dominate once it has a broader toolset than just customizable brushes.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment    
The brushes are very customizable, and this app has a professional feel. However, I feel as if this app is best for people trying to draw traditionalesque painting, not comics or similar styles. There are lineart tools, but what would make this app more accommodating would be features like clipping layers, alpha lock, a paint bucket tool, and a selection layer where you can draw on selection instead of just using the lasso tool. I haven't explored this app completely but I'm pretty sure it doesn't have those tools. Other than that, it's perfect for sketching and painting  as the app advertises.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment    
I've had this app fro about a month or three. I will have to say, it is perfect If you're hesitant, just buy it. It's so worth it.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

This is by far the best Drawing app in its class.  There is just too much potential and is a steal for the price and just keeps getting better. Hats off to the development team. I'm a long standing photoshop user and by compression Procreate is on par if not better for doing all kinds of artwork. Without a doubt the best investment one could make and give many hours of pleasure and discovery one could ever expect.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Totally welldesigned for iOS, and the current features are great The perspective guides are awesome, and the customizability options for the brushes are comprehensive to say the least. Great app, and it has so much room for expansion. It seems prettyfuturproof.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Amazing I love it Even it costs money its totally worth it I've been playing this for a while, But here are my suggestions;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Add a free version but the money costing one is better;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

I am new to drawing, taking my first lessons. I used Linea for the first 2 weeks, and I still love it for it's simplicity, with just enough options to make it a very fun and useful sketch app. Yet, I soon yearned for more options, and downloaded Procreate. At first, I missed the great simple options and controls of Linea, but by day 2 the power and beauty yes,  well functioning apps are a thing of beauty to me came through and I only use Procreate now.  While I am practicing beginning methods of sketching, I am also learning Procreate, which in itself offers many AHA moments when I learn how to do something I initially could not figure out. ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
With that said, if you are reading this and thinking of buying Procreate, do not hesitate... this app is simply amazing... even for the beginner Part of the joy is the terrific online support and forums. I have not had a question I could not readily find an answer to by searching the web. This app is worth so much more than the 4.99... kudos to the Procreate team and all the amazing users who have enabled me to find answers to my questions.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

I appreciate, deeply, that the editable document is autosaved. And yet, the lack of a clear export button on the home screen, or anywhere in the app, is ridiculous. I don't want to 'share', I want to SAVE a copy. Whatever the logic block exporting to other apps, etc please just add a saveexport feature to the landing page, so jpegs can be easily copied to my photos. ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment    
The program is otherwise  and the Apple Pencil does work well w it. Not sure about the review stating otherwise.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment    
For some reason I can't save videos directly to my photos  this was a recent issue that I've never had before, may be an issue with the device itself;Dep;Negative;Entertainment   
Procreate is beautiful and fluid in almost every way that an illustrative app could be. The brushes are incredible and I'm so excited to be able to customize and import new brushes outside of the basic set.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
It's user friendly interface is fantastic A beginner would find their feet very well in this program and thrive. ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
With that said there are a few tools that I'm surprised not to see on such a richly developed app.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment    
There isn't a crop tool which I find to be quite a bummer because personally, I don't know how I want my piece to be framed off until the end of the process. I could take it to another editing app and take care of it there but I'd prefer this to be all inclusive.;Usa;Neutral;Entertainment    
There's no type tool. ;Mis;Negative;Entertainment    
I know that this has been addressed many times, but I'm going to throw my opinion in there too. Graphic illustrator argument aside, implementing text is a gold mine text would help expand the appeal of this app to many different consumers and creative groups;Mis;Positive;Entertainment    
That's another huge bummer. There are brushes out there that are shaped like rectangles and circles but again it's really inconvenient.;Usa;Negative;Entertainment    
I'm not saying that this needs to have smartfill or anything, but these tools are incredibly important to even the most basic of drawing apps. ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment    
Again, I love this app It's a lovely and easy piece of gold for you and your Apple Pencil but it's important to hear what your consumers are missing in the product they love so much.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

Oh also the time lapse feature is great too;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
This app is really cool you get every single utensil for writing on here I don't know about you other guys but the app works well for me look what I drew;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
I so wish I could disable 2finger tap Undo gesture because no matter how I adjust the Palm Support setting, my palm keeps triggering Undo. It's BEYOND annoying I guess I will just have to invest in a special glove to use when sketching with this app. Otherwise, the app is great.;Usa;Positive;Entertainment    
So I couldn't open the app for a while but it turns out I just needed to give it a minute for the update to sink in, if that even makes sense. Anyways, it's up and running, all my work is saved and I couldn't be more grateful for the professional and optimistic responsesolution the makers gave me. Still not entirely sure what happened but I am back on track with Procreate and couldn't be happier  thank you;Mis;Negative;Entertainment   
This is an amazing app and it's mostly free.  Until one day, I went on and it glitches me off. I tried again and it still glitches me off every time. Fix please before I delete.;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
Im not one to write reviews unless its an app that really deserves it. As a proud new owner of an apple pencil, all I can say is how amazing the app is. Every tool is so easy to understand, unlike other drawing apps that have so much happening in one page that it gets overwhelming.. But this.. and plus, this is one that doesnt require a subscription. Perfect score all around. Thanks for this. ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
I've been using Procreate for years. I've seen it grow for the better. I am however experiencing glitch problems. I bought the iPad Pro 2 earlier in the week and I'm staring to see problems after a pinch zoom gesture to my desired canvas positionanglescale, it randomly snaps to a wrong position. It happens about 75 of the time. Please fix soon.;Dep,Usa;Negative;Entertainment   
I love this app. It's the best drawing app for iPad Pro in the WHOLE App Store. It practically replaces Photoshop for digital painting. Here's my issue there is no app in the App Store that is good for animation. There is a video recording feature in Procreate  already. PLEASE add an onion skin and animating feature to the app. You would make my life complete;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
First of all, the app is very well thought out. From the assortment of tools, to your own color pallet. The only issue I'm having right now is deleting my projects. I just don't need some of them, and they're just taking up space. Please tell me how to delete them, and if you can't, maybe add the feature;Usa;Positive;Entertainment    
I absolutely love using Procreate Drawing and lettering is so smooth. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to do digital art or hand lettering.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Procreate is officially my favorite illustrating application and it's really my initial recommendation for other artists who want to experiment. It may have a few cons here and there but overall it's a great app I do have recommendations of some sorts but I'll get to that later.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Organization  The app itself is organized, the clean look and theme makes it a clean workplace to work on. ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Brushes  The brush settings are what I've been looking for my entire life, settings that actually affect the brush The number of brushes are remarkable, each with their own texture. The ability to make and import custom brushes was a great touch, I'm honestly grateful for it.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Canvas Measurements  Thank goodness, I don't have to struggle converting pixels into whatever unit anymore, they're also effective and I love them.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Palette Customization  This feature is so smooth, I can just tap instead of drag or whatever else is excessive. It's so easy to just create palettes or artworks.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Adjustments  The best feature actually,  I have never seen an IOS application with the adjustments. e.g Gaussian Blur;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
SelectionLasso Tool  The Lasso Tool the tool with the S for an icon is useful in coloring in my opinion. However, freehand selection is often risky since you have to continue along. It would be nice to have a magnetic lasso tool like in Adobe Photoshop CC for people with unsteady hands like myself to use. Also a Select Pen should be added, like the one present in Medibang Paint, it would really help in coloring finer details since Automatic Selections tend to leave a few pixels, leaving the user to have to fill it in manually. ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
So far, I appreciate the app, though it could use a couple more upgrades here and there. The Magnetic Lasso and the Select Pen is what I'm really looking out for if there will be a future update for the app.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Polished app...Freezes too much...iPad Air 2 disappointed;Dep,Per;Negative;Entertainment   
I've love this app, but since the update it harder for me to draw smoothly with my stylus or my finger.;Sup,Usa;Positive;Entertainment

My I pad has the 9.3.5 update and this app keeps crashing. I know it says that it only works on 10.0.0 but I've had this app for so long that it used to work really well. Everything still works really well except for the fact that sometimes I want to cry because of how much it lags and crashes. I use the app to create bases for tiny animations and it's always crashing. This is very disappointing because the app is beautiful and it's perfect for everything I do but it keeps on crashing and lagging when I'm drawing. Please Help;Dep,Per;Positive;Entertainment   
Now the app is working for me again, thank you for ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

One of my fave drawing apps, love it. Lots of people are complaining about crashes, but I've had no such issue. UPADTE YOUR IPAD. ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
My only small gripe is a Bluetooth keyboard that was purchased before I owned an iPad Pro unfortunately lacks a command key. This makes it impossible for me to use certain shortcut commands. I'd love if you could integrate the CTRL key into the shortcuts or perhaps allow us to remap keystrokes;Mis;Positive;Entertainment    
Thank you for fixing Procreate It's the best drawing app I have stumbled across ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
This is the best drawing and sketching app I've used it's amazing with the iPad Pro and works great with the Apple Pencil like if I push hard on the screen it's more transparent and darker I recommend it if you have those things but still works with out the pencil.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
This is my most important app and my favorite.  I use it for work as a tattoo artist. I was experiencing the crashing after a few seconds or upon rotating the canvas or inserting images.;Dep;Positive;Entertainment  
Edit updating to iOS 10.3.2 solved the crashing issue.  Thanks for the amazing app;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
My favorite drawing app on the iPad Pro Great support and quick fix when a recent update kept crashing. Keep up the great work. Keeps getting better;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

I'm sure the developers will fix the bugs soon, but for now, it's pretty much unusable.;Usa;Positive;Entertainment   
Edit Dude, they fixed the bug so fast. That made me love this app even more. 3;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Quick, simple interface but as complex as any desktop application. Love the different brushes, and we can also download brushes. One of the best apps I used on my iPad ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

I loved the app before the latest update. It don't allow me to upload photos;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
The latest update made this app completely unusable. It crashes from just about anything. Im a tattoo artist and usually use it a couple hours a day for work. Guess it's back to pencil and paper until it's fixed. Thanks for ruining something that used to make my life way easier. Please fix it quickly;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
This is honestly the best app for iPad artists. It's so accessible and has all the brushes artists need. I've tried several other iPad art apps and none really come close.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

Loved this app and was using it on a daily basis. I used it this morning and now after the update it kicks me out every time I try to change the brush size, rendering it unusable.

I love this app but I currently can't use it because it crashes alllll the time. Pleaaassseee fix this 3;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
I'll like to begin with saying if you have crashing issues then you must visit Procreate's FAQ there they explain how to stop crashing. It worked for me. Anyway my reason for 4 stars and not 5 is for minor glitches sometimes the crop too won't move. otherwise amazing app. Though more tinkering is needed.;Usa;Negative;Entertainment    
Everything was perfect until now, I can't even open up my drawings anymore ;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
This app was the best drawing app I've ever used until the latest update. Brushes of all kinds, easytohandle layers, and a timerscreen recorder. I used it almost constantly for everything. Now, unfortunately, the app stays open for approximately thirty seconds before crashing. Please fix. I spent a full 6.00 on this and I still love it.;Dep;Positive;Entertainment   
Ever since the new update I've been experiencing crashing every time I do certain actions such as zooming in, clicking on the gallery button, etc. I know I am not the only one having these problems as I have seen other people's reviews.

I adore Procreate, the app is wonderful and I use it often. Before the newest update, the app crashed only every once in a while. This did not bother me. However, now, I cannot use the app because of so much crashing. I will open my drawing and maybe make a stroke or two, and then BAM It crashes. Please fix this;Dep;Positive;Entertainment

Please make an update to fix this;Dep;Positive;Entertainment

I love this app, but the only problem I have is shading. I wish there was some way to just make a new layer, pick a color and a brush, color the spots that you want to be shaded, and then do something to make the spots where you put down the color shaded. I mean, I know it sounds unrealistic, but maybe in the next update it could work;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

But,, recently after the lock' option has changed in December, it has really screwed me over. Now, I have an issue where I can't even open a canvas without it crashing within 2 seconds This has never happened before, and there's nothing that's truly causing it.

This is the best drawing app bar none for the iPad.   Possibly even the best app on any platform.  Yes I think it's that good.  Being able to touch and sketch while zooming in and moving around is the best drawing innovation.  And you can't replicate the ease of use you get with this app on a computer, even with a drawing tablet.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
This is the only program i use with my Apple Pencil. The responsiveness make everything go smooth. The brushes are a representation of what they claim to be exactly, from clouds, smoke, all the way to nebula star combos and customization. ;Mis;Neutral;Entertainment   
The only concerns or features that i have , is curve selection tool is needed for precision line work, re cropping after project has been started, More popular apps i can use for streaming such as youtube or Facebook would be ideal for the tutorial consumers, more alpha images to create user created brushes. ;Mis;Positive;Entertainment

Since getting an iPad Pro I've used Procreate extensively for a filmrelated project and it's been an unadulterated joy all the way. It's provided the missing piece to my digital art efforts simply by allowing me to draw and paint digitally with a minimum of fuss and associated technology. One stylus, one iPad, one happyasheck artist I love this application and the friendly, attentive, and responsive team behind it. I'd give it six stars if I could.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
This App is by far my Go to App for doing art. The one thing that would make this app unbeatable is having a pen tool like Photoshop.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
The line above says it all. Procreate is perfect for me, as it has liberated me from the tiresome Ihavetodothisinordertodothat syndrome. In other words, I can get effects that I dont even know I want, or knew existed, but when they are right there in front of me, Im happily blown away. Procreate is really a program to commit to, and a pleasure, because in a cold digital world, its something to love.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
This is a great app honestly For anyone who is an artist and wants a good program to use BUY THIS. It has almost all of the features of photoshop and you can have unlimited layers which makes it feel even more profession and worth your money. You can import your own pictures and even import more into the already opened file if you need a reference photo But with that being said, sometimes my app freezes randomly for a few seconds but Ive read about the internet and that could also be IOS 11 doing that so hopefully their most resent unpatriotic helps with that;Per;Positive;Entertainment  
This app is amazing for artists its going to be always the best;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
This is my only and best app since then i forgot all other apps and programs;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
i have been using this app for almost 7 years since it was a gray icon that icon should be back some how;Mis;Neutral;Entertainment   
Thanks to you but always not forgetting Apple Pencil which made this phenomenal app is above all;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
As of November 1, 2017  They did it  Apparently the new iOS is working finally and Savage is right on top of everything, and releasing their matching updates fast and furious.;Mis;Negative;Entertainment   
If you've never tried this app, you absolutely HAVE to.  It is beyond belief, and the forums are extremely helpful and wellmoderated.  Savage the developers are incredibly responsive.  It just doesn't get better than having the best app drawing and painting experience, AND the best support right there along with you.;Mis;Positive;Entertainment   
Make a Mario kart game in this game for update;Mis;Neutral;Games    
Enjoyed the game. Needs an update with more levels or a second game. It's actually a pretty good price for a MARIO game. Would like it if you could play offline, at least the tour, obviously needs to be online for rally. Overall, good game.;Mis;Positive;Games   
So awesome to remember my childhood;Mis;Positive;Games    
I can't open or play the game. This has been happening for a while. I keep on Getting that code please fix. I want to be able to play this game again;Dep;Positive;Games

I LOVE YOUR GAMESCONSOLES hah hah haaaah right so I'm a tooootal fan I love your Mario I have Donkey KongSuper Mario Maker sorry but I don't have the Nintendo Switch aaaand I have your 30th anniversary Mario amiibo congrats on the Mario character. AND WHY YOU RELEASE A CONSOLE TO SEE IT FAIL;Mis;Positive;Games    
Not with it at all. Unless you plan on replaying the same maps 5000 times each I guess.;Mis;Neutral;Games    
I really loved the game , but once you finish the worlds theres not much more to do and the toad rallys are gen pointless. Add more worlds Then the 10 would be well spent;Mis;Positive;Games   
The game is really good, great graphics, controls, smooth. The biggest problem I have is that I spent 10 for a app I beat in 3 days. There's no actual goal after the cake. Maybe a statue. Characters are all fairly easy to get. The levels are good I like the idea that each level changes depending on what color coins your going for. The game overall is just very short. First day of playing I reached max level for the castle that's seriously underwhelming.;Mis;Positive;Games   
For people who bought the game, could you make level maker Because after you complete the tour, there's nothing else, plus 10 dollars is no joke. I'm not talking like major features like changing how it looks or anything, just a nice simple editor;Mis;Positive;Games    
I like this game. Mario is a personal favorite character of mine for 10 years, but this game almost made me stop playing Mario games forever. I hate that you have to pay 9.99 for the rest of the levels. I mean come on I should have expected this because every free to play game has you pay for stuff. I know Family Guy The Quest for Stuff makes you pay for stuff. Now because of that problem, I deleted it and I'll get it back unless you change it.;Mis;Negative;Games    
Love the Mario Games, so i'm glad to see Nintendo coming to the Smart phones now. This game is a must have for any true fan. Only issue i have is we need more levels. When are we going to get World 7 and World 8 ;Mis;Positive;Games   
For 10 they should release more levels finished it last year. And still nothing new;Mis;Neutral;Games    
It's an incredible game reminds you of Mario 64, until you reach the second world. Normally games that are free still make money because making a purchase will get you further ahead than those who play for free. This game plays the exact same way until you beat Bowser in the first world, and get told the only way to continue playing is to purchase it for 9.99. After that, a must play turns into a must delete. ;Mis;Positive;Games   
The app at first draws you in, however, once you get going you realize the rest of the maps are 9.99 and is a complete rip off. It took me an half an hour to complete half the maps only to realize the other half wasn't free. And now I'm basically finding myself bored of the one thing I can do in the game, because I'm isolated to it without spending money.;Mis;Negative;Games    
Mario kart and super mario bros on ipad;Mis;Positive;Games    
I like the game but I enjoy the road rally. But I don't like you need to get toad rally tokens. They're kinda hard to get.;Mis;Positive;Games    
I purchased the app and I'm still unable to go to the next world. It states for 9.99 you have access to all worlds but this was not the case for me. I was unable to contact Nintendo about the issue. Don't waste your money;Dep;Positive;Games    
An amazing foray into the world of mobile gaming for Mario. It's a simple game with a one time payment to open all its features. I was hesitant, but now that I've purchased it I'm delighted and surprised with how much fun I have every time I hop into this app. It's easy if you want it to be, challenging if you want it to be, and 100 quality Nintendo fun. Bravo;Mis;Positive;Games   
This game isn't a true homage to the legacy of Mario, and purists won't love it. But at its core, Super Mario Run is a good mobile game that translates the arcade style of Mario well.;Mis;Positive;Games    
This app may seem flashy to some but please do not waste your time It costs TEN DOLLARS to buy the next levels WHY WOULD YOU GUYS RUIN WHAT COULD OF BEEN AN OKAY GAME Thanks a lot what a rip off;Mis;Positive;Games    
I love the game, but I think Nintendo should add items, such as the double cherry, super acorn, super bell and many others.;Mis;Positive;Games   
This game is awesome but y do people vote it 1 star I looked at most of the 1 star reviews and most say they like the game but why I think it's because they don't want to pay 10 dollars for the game but the truth is it's almost as good as new super Mario bros U and that game costs 60 And no one complains about that Smr is an under rated game;Mis;Positive;Games   
I love it you can be different characters;Mis;Positive;Games   
I really like this game. It's just so fun and it only took me 2 days to complete the game. Ignore the bad reviews. I hope they can add more worlds;Mis;Positive;Games   
Nintendo has made some of the first great video games that made the gaming industry a big thing, but this, WHAT ARE YOU DOING Nintendo. I thought this was just a mobile Mario platformer but it's ruined just like sugar crush.;Mis;Negative;Games    
I really appreciate that MARIO is finally on iOS, but the gameplay is not great and I keep getting frustrated that I can't go backward or hit bricks that are too close together. I'm going to stick with the NES in my living room for now. I hope Nintendo tries again;Usa;Negative;Games   
I thought it was freeI liked the game but I don't think it was ;Mis;Positive;Games    
worth 10 dollars .Five levels are free rest are 10 dollars ;Mis;Positive;Games    
My point is that if your looking for a free app this isn't the ;Mis;Positive;Games    
After beating the game with the world's, there's not a whole lot to do. Yeah there's the Toad Rally, but that gets old after a while. For 10, you think they would update with new levels. Heck, even free games push out new levels;Mis;Positive;Games    
In short, it\'s a fun game to play, just gets old and repetitive. Please update and add something new.;Usa;Positive;Games

Fun but way too expensive and short for the price, meh;Mis;Positive;Games    
Another cheap way for Nintendo to get your money because you have to pay to unlock the stages for money. Plus you only get to play 5 stages and don't get me started on DLC from smash conclusion Nintendo is a greedy company ;Mis;Negative;Games    
Great Game, Simple to learn but very to get all the Pink,Purple,and Black Coins. Now first things first 10 is CHEAP, SOOOOOOO many people complain, its really not that bad lets see, oh Mario Run is 10 so what, almost EVERYONE has a phone or a iPod but not everyone can afford a 300 dollar Nintendo switch and a 60 game. So 10 for a full fledged game is Cheap. Ok, 2 My only Request is to have playing the tour NOT RALLY be Wifi Free. That's it Thanks Nintendo ;Mis;Positive;Games    
I love Mario Brother games and was so excited to come across this one but was saddened when the sound wouldn't work. FYI I have a iPhone 7 plus and checked the game settings.;Dep,Sup;Negative;Games   
Fun game but not fun enough to have to buy the other worlds with actual money so I deleted it;Mis;Negative;Games    
The app is really good except for to do a lot more, you have to pay for the next levels. You can only do World 1 and it's super easy. Then for World 2, you have to unlock a pack with more characters and toad colors for toad tally, which all has to be paid for. After you defeat the fist level for Bowser, you're pretty much done with the game unless you pay for the extras;Mis;Positive;Games    
I love the game, gathering different coin colors, and especially the Rally and building the kingdom. I just wish that my kingdom was large enough to hold all my special items at one time.  Also,  I have 800,000 coins...and have nothing to spend it on...have purchased one or more of every item. ;Mis;Positive;Games   
I want more rainbow bridges and special items please ;Mis;Positive;Games    
Terrible, it's not mario at all.;Mis;Negative;Games    
Hi Nintendo. I was thinking that you should let all worlds for free for the ones that can not purchase it. Like this one time I was playing toad rally and I had to win purple toads but you had to purchase it so can you please make it free it will be fair for the ones that can not purchased it and you can get great reviews and support So please do that right now and thank you so much and remember that I am a super Mario fan;Mis;Positive;Games    
The game is fun but I HATE that you have to pay 10 to play from world 2 on, this is ridiculous, it shouldn't cost 10 to play the game after it says free in the App Store Everything else is fine with the game though.;Mis;Positive;Games    
I like the game but 10 for one package is too much. It should only cost 5. Please fix this.;Mis;Positive;Games    
But it's never updated.  I beat the game in a week;Sup;Neutral;Games    
It's awesome but I can't get in to the 4th world for some reason wow I downloaded that for nothing;Dep;Positive;Games   
I love this game so much. But you should have toad rally tournaments. For example you can make or join one. When you make one, you then wait for seven other people. When you join one, you join everybody else and then wait for other people. But you can also say you need to have like 1,000 toads to join. However you can have up to 250 less toads then needed the 8 players battle in toad rallies. And the Winner wins like purple and yellow toads;Mis;Positive;Games   
This game was fun at first when I initially bought it but now I barely look at it. Please add more mini games not just statues and fireworks, I would like to actually play and use the game mechanics. I'd like to see a little more investment into this game.;Mis;Positive;Games   
Personally, I think this game is awesome. It's Super Mario Bros in your pocket and your phone is smaller than a DS, is it I don't know but I'm pretty sure a 6S and under is smaller than a DS. Anyways,. The idea to do this was really cool except for on thing......if you really wanna play the whole game, your gonna need a ten in you wallet that's available. This is I think the only problem people have had with this game but the game will become more popular if you just end up making the full game like 0.99 at the purchase of the game. Otherwise, this game is awesome.;Mis;Positive;Games   
It's a great game but we the people have to pay for the other worlds that is unreasonable if that's the way it is gonna be list it as the cost of all the worlds instead of free thanks Nintendo even though you won't see this;Mis;Positive;Games    
Super Mario Run is a blast to play, however I've noticed a bug. If you win on toad rally the game locks up. You are unable to select change opponent or change kingdoms both of these options work if you loose the rally. Quitting the app and reopening does not cause a loss of won toads.;Usa;Positive;Games   
Kind of lame that you can't stop running. I get that's the whole point of it. That's why it's a 3 from me and not a 2.;Mis;Negative;Games    
Don't get me wrong, I love the game but one of my biggest gripes is the Price. I mean come on, 9.99 10 for a simple mobile game That's a little expensive compared to other games in the App Store. Because I don't really want to pay 9.99 to unlock all the levels of the game. If Nintendo could do this then they should lower the price down to maybe 4.99 5 then yes I would definitely buy the full version of the game. And I bet a lot more people will buy the game and Nintendo would make more money by doing this.;Mis;Positive;Games    
I beat the whole game. After that, you can play with other people but they are the same worlds. It gets old. It was worth the 10 when I was trying to get to save princess Peach.;Mis;Positive;Games    
Games just crashes every time I download it;Dep;Neutral;Games   
I find it unfair that you must pay 10 just to continue a free game;Mis;Negative;Games    
Super Mario Run is an okay game. The graphics are nice. The gameplay is repetitive. The Rally mode adds replayability. You have to get Rally tickets to even play it. It just counters itself in every way with its features. It's not that good. There are a lot of people saying ignore the hate, but I am just saying what I think. Super Mario Run is a bland game, not worth 10. If this game wasn't Mario, it would be less than 2 or even free. Unpopular opinion, but I just don't like it.;Usa;Positive;Games   
I was really excited about this and it played as I was expecting but if you want all the worlds you have to pay 10 for it which is misleading and the reason I gave it 2 stars.;Mis;Negative;Games   
Menu will not pop up when completing an easy mode level. Why? Fix it immediately;Usa;Positive;Games   
Definitely great for me  my daughter. We love it.;Mis;Positive;Games

This app is super fun except for one problem. In order to play the game you need to pay 10 Personally I believe the price should go down;Mis;Positive;Games    
The game had only two power ups Which are the star and mushroom powers And the game needs more things to do and more worlds and levels to play After you beat the tour levels it's quiet boring and there is just nothing else to do;Mis;Neutral;Games    
good game but it requires you to be online to be played, i dl games mostly to use in air planes road trips and places were there is no connectivity, this game defeat the purpose of a single player and twist it to some 3rd party wicked agendA;Sup;Negative;Games

The game is pretty fun but it's not realtime at all. Racing a shadow and the whole idea of stunts making or breaking a race are kind of bogus;Dep;Positive;Games   
For me it was free, but I could only do the first level without having to pay. But I had to pay for every other level, so I didn't really like how it did that.;Mis;Negative;Games    
I paid 10 for an app that doesn't work. It constantly crashes  I end up losing toads because of it. Disappointing. Would definitely uninstall if I hadn't paid for it.;Dep;Negative;Games   
this game honestly is so fun but my one problem is once u finish 3 levels u have to by the rest of the game and a lot of people parents don't let there kids spend money on games but if it was free than everybody would have the joy of playing the whole game. otherwise i thought it is great;Mis;Positive;Games    
Nintendo has yet made another perfect game with mario The only sad thing is is that you have to buy the full game to be able to unlock all of the characters. But that's ok You can still be mario, toad, blue Yoshi, and toadette;Mis;Positive;Games   
Game is great  it isn't free though so that's misleading. ;Dep;Negative;Games    
Worst part is you have to reset the app after every round of toad rally unless you lose.  The buttons won't take you out of it.;Usa;Negative;Games   
And you have to play toad rally to get other characters.;Mis;Positive;Games    
Only world 1 is free and short Toad Rally competitions. The other 5 or 6 world access, you need to pay 10 minus 1 cent. If i knew that before, I wouldn't download the game.;Mis;Positive;Games

I lived this game. Amazing and fun. Liked the idea. Cool how you can play with one hand. But then, I learned that to complete more levels you had to pay. Most professional video game maker companies don't require to pay to continue playing. For example, take Clash Royale. Legendary game, any video gamer knows it. You can play the whole game without paying a dime, but on the side, there is a optional feature where you can buy gems or coins. Or, maybe decide for no coins in the game, like slither.io. You have to learn from the best. Please fix this, and I guarantee better reviews.;Mis;Positive;Games   
This game is really fun but it is not worth 10 dollars. Also, there are some glitches in toad rally that are really frustrating. Annoying and fix it.;Dep;Negative;Games

I have been a huge Mario fan since I was little and I was so excited when I was looking through the App Store to see the Nintendo app. However, once I completed world one it said I had to pay for the rest of the worlds to unlock them. I got the app because it was free and I find it pointless to pay for games and it was very disappointing to find that you could only do the first world. I have been waiting for Mario to come an app for YEARS and now it is and I still can't play it. The app was fun and it let me down...;Mis;Positive;Games    
You need to pay 10 dollars for the full game;Mis;Negative;Games    
Right. Is this game is boring and now I ran out of toad tallies because I play with a lot of people and  I always WIN and I have to pay for toad tallies and I have to pay for going to level four and buying some dumb screen of bowser how dumb is that even though I have created a club Nintendo account yesterday for u Nintendo  and they just want ;Usa;Negative;Games

Please stop this Why would you threaten, name call, hate on, and bash on them You know that they are innocent and not everyone can afford the game. And even I think that 9.99 for six worlds is very steep. So get a life and rewrite your review into your opinion for the game.;Mis;Negative;Games    
I love the game till I needed to buy the levels. What's the point. At lesser make that feee and purchase something else;Mis;Positive;Games    
I think it's a good game that kills time fast, but if you could add some more content that would be nice and maybe adding your road rally tickets to go over 99. Because I actually bought the game for the worlds, not the toad wallet but it almost feels like a waste to get all the special coins when it didn't even add to your total road rally tickets, but I still think it's solid and it should be higher rated then it is;Mis;Positive;Games   
Probably worth more than one star given all the work and promoting put into it but if there's any app out there of which it's total purpose is so obviously set up to generate cold hard cash for the developers, this is it So, yeah yeah, we all know why developers create the applications we use in this wonderful capitalistic society of ours, but to not even pretend that the apps number one purpose might be for entertainment purposes goes against recent app dev norms  Once in the app I found it difficult to begin to enjoy the app. The obvious traps designed solely to introduce you to how the developers plan to separate you from your hard earned cash are unavoidable. I think the first few times I opened the app long ago there may have been a hint of game play, but now I don't see it. The message is clear pay or leave. Thanks anyway, bye.;Mis;Positive;Games    
Mario automatically runs and why I have to pay if he writes that the game is free;Mis;Positive;Games    
Since this app has come out, it has only worked twice. . . . I always keep on getting an error code 8041000, try again after finding a better connection. I have a 1g speed, never have a issue with other apps. No help from Nintendo.;Dep;Positive;Games

Back then, the graphics were not so detailed, but at least you could control the character.;Usa;Neutral;Games    
Sadly, Nintendo took away the fundamental ability to control the character of Mario so I am not using this app anymore. How is it a game when I can't control the character? Bring back how it was.;Usa;Negative;Games    
You can't control anything but the ability to jump. Please add more features.;Usa;Positive;Games    
Your mission is to collect all pink, then all purple, then all black coins in each and every level of the game.;Mis;Neutral;Games

Not only is it a failure in the mediocre series but you have to buy every other world but 1. Never play this game.;Mis;Positive;Games    
As always from Nintendo, Super Mario Run is an extremely polished experience, which justifies the price. I've gotten all coloured coins in all levels by now, which unlocks secret levels. If you're a completionist, you'll spend quite some time and tries to get everything.;Mis;Positive;Games   
The always online nature of the game detracts one star for me, as online shouldn't be required for the Tour mode.;Sup;Neutral;Games    
I was hyped when this game was coming out. I payed the 10 of course because I love Nintendo. It looked incredible but once it came out I got it day one I pretty much just started drifting from it and stopped playing it. I'm just being honest. The graphics and visuals are incredible and well done, but how the game plays is just meh. I found myself very irritated playing it. I agree with other reviews on this, but not being able to move back is rage inducing. If anything kept me playing at all, it was the additional characters. But that was not pulling me in enough to keep me playing. Overall, the graphics are incredible but just how the game was designed to play was just a bad idea.;Usa;Positive;Games    
Nintendo...this is a mobile game. Stop with all the frickin dialog boxes and tutorials. Only you could make a horizontal platformer complicated. You should not have to invest 45 minutes to get started with a mobile game. ;Usa;Negative;Games

When I was cleaning out some of my apps, I accidentally deleted it, and now, when I try logging in, it says user is already linked to another device.

10 would be a great price for this game, if it was not an inapp purchase.  I think that is the problem every one has with the price.  Not how much it is, but that it is an IAP.  Fix that Nintendo and you will get better reviews.;Mis;Positive;Games    
Nintendo is still showing its greed.  I would pay 10 for it, but not as an IAP.  This is how Nintendo keeps you from installing it on more than one device with out you paying for it multiple times. ;Mis;Negative;Games    
Still needs to fix IAP problem.;Dep;Negative;Games   
So I got the game, I was really excited but then when I finished levels 13 I wanted more but then I noticed that u had to buy just to play more.;Mis;Positive;Games    
Making me pay for more levels is bs;Mis;Negative;Games    
Price of any app should not justify bad reviews, if you like something, the monetary value is secondary. Let's face it, Crying because of 10 is just ridiculous. I need to say something because of the unfair reviews.;Mis;Negative;Games    
Where this game really fails is the controls. If you are going to make an endless runner MARIO game, the controls MUST be impeccable to compensate for the lack of freedom that regular Mario games offer. The touch control is not responsive enough, and having 3D Touch disabled doesn't help. The game is unnecessarily hard to play since you do not have the precision of a gamepad. I believe this echoes other reviewers main frustration with the game.;Per,Usa;Negative;Games   
Make more land for the kingdom building. ;Mis;Neutral;Games    
And make it easier to go backwards when running , instead of a bunch of wall jumping and holding the character flying in the air to go back. It's annoying. Especially when you don't want to waste the bubbles or run out;Usa;Positive;Games    
Once I got through tear 1 you have to pay 10 to play the rest of the game. I know that this is a game with in app purchases but come on, why would someone pay that it's a waste of money. And the game should be non wifi only.;Sup;Negative;Games    
The game was good at first but you have to pay 10 for the next thing. Got boring easily I could just get a Wii U and play it. It's a waste of money wouldn't buy it.;Mis;Neutral;Games    
I want luigi but he is too hard to get and it gets boring in 2 minutes and you have to pay;Mis;Negative;Games    
To make the game more fun you should add ways to go into the toad houses and customize them by using coins to get furniture and expand the houses. Another thing is, adding more rainbow bridges so there would be more room in the world would be nice. And lastly add more mini games to get coins and tickets;Usa;Positive;Games    
This game is a great game. One thing they should add is the ability to visit your friends kingdoms. I like playing as yoshi btw.;Mis;Positive;Games   
Also can you please add more levels like 6 more worlds but they are a lot harder and you can be toad by beating them all without linking you Nintendo account. Thanks for reading. If your Nintendo please add what I said it would be great;Usa;Positive;Games   
I don't usually ever play video games but this one is AMAZING It's so fun to play and I'm addicted to it, but I wish I could visit my friend's kingdoms;Mis;Positive;Games

I cannot play this game unless connected to the internet, so airplane mode makes it a no go. I have an iPad Pro that I would enjoy this on but can't play it there if it is on my phone unless I log in each time. Neat game, but these are show stoppers for me. That was a 10 lesson I don't think Apple will get to teach me again.  Here it is July of 2017 and I have yet to even open the app again on my phone.  Yeah, this is one that is not needed.;Sup;Positive;Games

Finished the game...it was stupid;Mis;Negative;Games    
One of the best games ever Nintendo. D It may cost 10  it is because it is free to download. Like stop complaining. Not every game is perfect. Now plz stop being picky. Nintendo do not listen to them. Because I love yo game.  I love all yo Mario games.;Mis;Positive;Games

Not sure if this is just my device, but I have an iPhone 7 Plus that has superb battery life, usually only goes down to 88 at the end of the work day with moderate use, HOWEVER upon downloading this app, on completely idle even while turning background app refresh off, it DESTROYED my battery life. Within a few hours of the app just being on my phone, it was down to 50. With the app being so fun it's a shame that this was a problem, enough for me to completely remove the app from my phone. After removing the app from my phone, I know have the stable battery life I once had before. Super big letdown.;Per;Positive;Games   
Had this game on my phone for 3 days, deleted, not impressed;Mis;Negative;Games    
I love this game I'm addicted. But there is  one issue I don't like which is, that I don't like how when you get to world 2 that you have to pay 10 to move forward. If they fixed that issue I would give 5 stars.;Mis;Positive;Games    
Micro transactions everywhere unplayable. Fix asap.;Usa;Neutral;Games    
Ever since I was forced to update and confirm new terms the game is horrible. I'm not free to play the games I played before and get forced to take tutorials and rally's. Not cool. The deal was I pay a good amount of  for an app that I get to play.;Dep;Negative;Games

People always complain about price , I get there are a lot of games that make you spend on upwards of 100 bucks for in game purchases which is highway robbery at best, however there is a lot of money and RD to build a great game platform and the servers to run them , I always believed you pay for quality , Great over all game;Mis;Positive;Games   
This app is great but I why should u pay money for the levels It is a fun app for people and I think you should try it;Mis;Positive;Games   
The game itself is pretty cool, but can you add more inapp purchases Like Red Toads for 29.99 and Purple Toads for 39.99 and etc.;Mis;Positive;Games

You get to play 3 levels before you're met with the choice of painstakingly collect pink coins from all past levels more annoying than it sounds as you can't feasibly backtrack once you've passed one by  compete in MANY rallies that you can and WILL lose, which, btw, have a limited amount of attempts or pay the paywall troll his mighty fee to progress.

I've gotten an hour or two of play time just from collecting every coin on the first 3 levels which by the way are absolutely free and offer you a chance to see what's in store before you pay The game is incredibly smooth and well polished and may even convince me to drop the 10 needed to unlock all the other levels 55;Mis;Positive;Games

This was good but any MARIO player concord the worlds and bought everything by now and I am literally playing the same thing OVER and OVER WT....can they add a new world, be able to grow your kingdom and us it not just put statues. Something worth while to use your coins for. I don't want to buy statues Seriously...come up with something I can use like star power or bonuses or come up with something better;Mis;Positive;Games

Nintendo, i want this game offline without A purchase screen;Mis;Negative;Games    
Please make it better Nintendo JUST PLS;Mis;Positive;Games    
I have completely enjoyed this game all the way through It was worth every penny If you didn't buy it then you have no room to complain.;Mis;Positive;Games   
I have collected every item and every coin and have enjoyed every second of it. The game is more than just tapping the screen, there is actual strategy involved. The great thing about the game is that it has challenges for all skill levels, just like most MARIO games do. The beginner will not be turned off while the hardcore player will enjoy the challenges associated with collecting all the coins, Toads, items and playing Rally Mode against tougher competitors.;Mis;Positive;Games   
You can't beat what you get for 10. Most of us gamers will go out and pay at least 60 for a new game and not give it a second thought, but the moment they charge 10 for an app everyone is up in arms. Pay the price and give it a chance There's a lot more to this game than what you see at first glance;Mis;Positive;Games   
Now, the biggest flaw that I have found thus far. When you max out your Toads it will make it extremely difficult to collect more Toads of a certain color. If you are like me, you have collected everything but the 2500 Toads required to obtain the classic Luigi statue. Every time you win a rally it will appear you have been given the appropriate amount of Toads, but check again. I usually only get about half of the color Toad it says I got when I win a rally while I'm maxed out. This made it very difficult to get the 2500 green toads I needed. I was finally able to achieve it by losing a few rallies on purpose that didn't require betting any green Toads, but it took way longer than it should have. Nintendo, please fix this bug, or please remove the Toad limit;Usa;Positive;Games    
Overall, it's a fantastic game I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the annoying maxed out Toad bug. Maybe Nintendo will fix that and I will change my review. Until then it's a solid 4 star game and worth the price;Usa;Positive;Games   
Edit Nintendo removed the toad limit and now everything is right with the world As promised I changed me review to a 5 star. Thanks for listening Nintendo;Mis;Positive;Games   
As a business traveler who spends most of his phonetime on planes, the lack of offline play is a deal breaker. Consider adding offline support.;Sup;Positive;Games    
Although, it is pretty similar to the game I grew up playing, I will not pay 9.99 for this, or any other game for my phone. There are a few flaws in this game that make it even more unlikely that a higher volume of people WOULD pay the 10 bucks just to get to round 2. Great idea for a game though, again.;Mis;Positive;Games    
It saids that it's so better with the full version and is but you have to pay money which I want it all for free so can you plzzzzzzzzzzzzz make it free;Mis;Positive;Games   
Really you have to pay ten dollars to play a game ;Mis;Positive;Games    
I have been collecting all of the star coins and completing all of the daily tasks, I have found myself with 99 rally tickets, I feel like I waste them when I collect more tickets than I need and they just disappear. What I'm trying to get to is, can you make the friend section have a send gift button so that I can give away my extra tickets;Mis;Positive;Games    
Great for the first week but unfortunately they never add levels. For 10 you'd expect they would add new levels now and again. Because of this I hardly play anymore;Mis;Positive;Games

Ok so let's gets his straight how is it that there is 8 Worlds in most of the Mario gamer but only 6 in Super Mario Run Well I had a idea to add more Worlds in super Mario Run . 1 of the worlds could be a ice world with a few different levels another world could be a Jungle world with a few different levels like I said and also a Volcanic world would be nice and there's dropping meteors from the sky u have to dodge.And for a little bonus if u collect all the coins in all the new worlds the bonus could be a SpaceGalaxy world like he special worlds there is in some games ;Mis;Positive;Games

What a rip off After the first world, with only 3 levels, you have to pay 9.99 to be able to go on to additional worlds. That only buys you 5 more worlds, after which you are done. Finished the entire game in about 2 hours of play time. Fit 9.99 I would expect A LOT more than that. Extremely disappointing to say the least;Mis;Neutral;Games    
Hey it's me again I was also wondering is there going to be a super Luigi run where it is the same levels you have to beat the levelsin 30 seconds mario is NOT playable and it plays like super Luigi u but you just tap to jump again also nabbit as character again;Mis;Positive;Games

I paid the money because I love the game. I figure 10 dollars I'll get my fix and money back. But where are more levels  It's been almost a year now and no new levels. It's boring and I finished the game in a day. It isn't of substance;Mis;Positive;Games    
The game still requires an internet connection to play  Give me a break  If I pay 10 for a game, it should be playable where and when I want to play, regardless of whether or not I have access to the internet.  I get that Nintendo wants to protect itself from piracy, but this is simply too restrictive.  This really is a deal breaker Nintendo  I won't pay 10 for a game with such restrictions  no other nonInternetbased game I've ever purchased for my iPhone has required a connection to play.  SMR shouldn't be any different.;Sup;Positive;Games    
Me and my grandpa spent like 2 hours trying to link my nintendo account.. It didn't work... I still love this game though.;Usa;Negative;Games  
I've played this game since it came out and absolutely love it. I thought I'd hate the auto run, but the way the levels are designed it's pretty awesome gameplay. As far as the design, graphics, and gameplay I give it 5 stars. My overall rating is 4 stars because you can't play it offline.;Mis;Positive;Games   
I grew up playing the Super Mario games, and this is a great addition to the franchise. I hope Nintendo comes out with more Super Mario games for iPhone ... and figures out a way to make them playable offline.;Sup;Positive;Games

I personally dont think it is worth the ten dollars;Mis;Positive;Games    
No you have to pay 10 just to get a little bit of Mario run. if you you want the real thing play the original Marios.no wonder they havent made a Mario game for the phone ever. And it has no replay ability;Mis;Positive;Games    
You just get to play for one world, and after achieving all the goals, when you get to world 2 you cant keep playing unless you spend 10, if yo dont youre not allowed to advance in the game.. and personally i think its a huge bummer. The game is fun but if we have to pay 10 dollars every time we want to upgrade.. it just ruins the fun. Its ok to being able to buy characters or gadgets and stuff but this is just exaggerated.;Usa;Positive;Games    
I remember waiting a month for this game to finally come out and when it finally did I was overjoyed with it at first but then when I tried to go the the next area I had to pay And so I deleted the game and waited another month and again had to pay for more levels cmon guys;Usa;Neutral;Games    
Fun at first but no replay value. The best mode, Toad Rally, gets old after hitting the majority of the goals. ;Usa;Positive;Games

Overall, this game is a blast. Classic Mario feeling, playable on mobile devices, the music is amazing, and being able to listen to music stored on your phone is great But, if the game were able to play music from Pandora, Spotify, or YouTube Music, it would make play even more enjoyable for people;Sup,Usa;Positive;Games   
This game was well worth 10 but I don't have a lot of iTunes music and I was wondering if you guys could add it so you can use other music apps like Spotify,Pandora etc. you guys are awesome;Sup,Usa;Positive;Games

I use Enlight in an indie capacity to improve my IG and FB pics on vacations and professional game development excursions, and the app has been essential to my work for about two years.  The tutorials are super helpful and it was worth the few dollars I originally spent on it.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
So I usually never bother to write reviews but this app blew me away. I would say it even rivals professional tools like photo shop. They might have more control but Enlight is so easy to use that I would much rather use it more than any thing else.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Some of the features that I've tested were very cool. It looks like you can create amazing art with this, however, it is not very intuitive. Still trying to figure out how to end a session and start a new one. I'm sure the information is available, just how deep will you need to dig to uncover it, who knows. But once you have it figured out, it's going to be a great tool.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos   
They have intentionally broken the legacy app. I have never seen a developer take away something  tools one already had in a previous version. This is a new low in the pursuit of revenue. I would urge you to not use Enlight as it would encourage this kind of behavior in other developers. Just delete Enlight and move on. Quality photo editing apps are a dime a dozen and for a monthly subscription there certainly are much higher quality editors out there than Enlight. In any case you decide. Very best to all.   ;Dep;Positive;PhotosVideos    
After contacting support and following their repair instructions the app is back to being fully functional. I extend my apologies to the developers for my bombastic review. I should have contacted support before jumping to conclusions. Embarrassing Yes. Humbling Yes.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos

i paid money for this, and now i can't download it anymore. the company that holds enlight has basically ripped me off because i have a device that isn't compatible.;Sup;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
Even following a tutorial, this app makes me feel like my 97 yearold grandma trying to code a time travel app. I want to break something.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos    
The new update isn't compatible with the iPhone 5, only the 5s and up I paid for this app and now I can't update it. I want my money back ;Sup;Negative;PhotosVideos    
It works on the iPhone 7 plus but not the iPad. Click, Enlight page opens then in about 1520 seconds it shuts down.  ;Dep,Per,Sup;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
This app has great features. Very easy to use and fast . I like that all your images are in the bottom of your screen for better selection. And all the different options for editing your imagesfilters, tools,brushes,text, adjust and clarity etc .;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Unlike most other apps,Enlight is extremely easy to use and to be a little more creative with your pictures. It is also professional and good for fixing poorly taken pictures. I would most definitely recommend this app.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I just say. I was a bit hesitant rant in downloading and purchasing this Enlight app. I was looking for an app that had everything for photo editing. I'm happy to say gat this Enlight app is one awesome and amazing app. I'm not too patient in watching the instructions on n how to use the app. Don't get me wrong. I am patient in other things. I like to just jump into it and figure it out on my own. That I did. I may not know all the features on his app, but I know enough to do what I want to do to photos. Thank you very much to your he app designer, creator, and to those involved in this amazing app. Oh, I also like thank you for the response time in support technical issues. Yes they do respond when you are having fun sues with you he app,  thought I had issues with the app, but it turns out I had forgotten to do another step. So there was never an issue with the app. Thanks again Enlight.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
There are a ton of options for photo editing in this app.  It is a lot of fun.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Let's you exercise your imagination with your own photos. Fun and easy to use;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
This is the best app I ever seen, easy to use a lot of different tools and the result will blow your mind .;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
This is a great app if you like to edit photos and put filters on without having to sit in the Instagram app for an hour getting t perfect. You can do pretty much anything when it comes to manipulation of photos. Only downside is there's not really a good drawingsketching function. Overall good purchase.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos   
So far this is the best app so far to edit photo I'm still trying to figure out to use this and the cool thing about it is that the tutorial is there to guide you thru ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Every time I take a shot I use this wonderful app I use the cropping feature every time I copy an Instagram pic;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Love it Super cool app and lots to do, takes a min to figure it out but it's worth it;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I love Enlight so im confused why I see reviews on Enlight 2 where people are so mad .I paid for the first Enlight so am I getting bumped back to a free version and now I have to pay again Someone please explain;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
Well worth the money I could lose many hours a day by editing lol;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Takes a bit to learn but fun once you get it.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
It's my belief, that subscription services for software, after the initial purchase payment will be the down fall of these company's. Probably 95 of the people are buying these apps for fun, and reactions use. There are many other company's that offer editing programs. It's sad to see company being so clueless to good business practices. If you build a good product people will buy endlessly, even paying a few more bucks with each new development.To force a new business practice down people throats just doesn't work. Although I like your product will move on to something else. Good Luck ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
Like having a pic software package on your phone. ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
I use this often. Thanks so much for the ability to make my pics look great;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I've just begun to discover all the amenities;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
Enlight 2 is a separate app from this.  And it is an extremely expensive subscription.  I REFUSE.  So I'll be using other apps, but not this one, and not the new version.  I cannot recommend this app.  Choices are good.  Subscriptions apps are not.;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
This is the best app for photos but the new app yall made is not good i love enlight but photofox is not goodi don't know how to use that one and IV this for a year so got photofox i can't use it please fix i can't get in even but i love this app this is all i need xoxo no hate i love enlight a lot not so  much photofox;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Everything I've ever wanted in a photo manip app. Don't need anything else. Like nothing. Not even a newer version. Seriously. Not for 4 a month. Nope. This one is perfect. ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
So this app was not prepared to handle some of the new cloud features incorporated by apple throughout a single owner's apple devices, and I was at first, a little to harsh with my words and 1 star rating on something I'm sure the developer had heard from countless masses having the same issue. The company reached back out to me to help troubleshoot the root problem and showing a developer that had pride in their creations, wanting to give all who paid for the app to get a functional tool that their name was attached to. I understand an overhaul that was needed, and seen after downloading and playing with the new replacement app, that an update was not as cost effective to cover all the work that was put in to accommodate apples evergrowing feature hurdles, but in stronger in app tools as well as a more for now that is seamless user interface and response time to the selected tool this one had a few hiccups in how fast it applied and following path... but nothing that could upset be adapted quickly in use ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
So I changed my 1 star for a 5 star customer care and personal response time, but docked 1 area for having to purchase a new app as the solution to my problem... I did buy the one time pro feature option before even getting past the demo screen, that much new faith in this developer.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
Bought the app and it does not work Don't waste your money.;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos   
No you have the poor version and the rich version don't bother paying for this one  and save roughly 40 bucks for the other version everything seems to be money now days;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
This is an amazing app I've owned several for different editing and effects use, but this app alone does it all. It's very well designed and user friendly.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
My only hangup is that some navigational controls are frustrating, such as switching tools while editing.;Usa;Negative;PhotosVideos   
This is, by far, the best photo editing app. You can do so many creative things with all of your pictures. Add text, merge photos, and more. I'd give this app 10 out of 5 stars if that was possible. Photographers playground.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Love the app because it's so easy to do and it even provides tutorials;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Great app so full of all one needs for perfect iPhoneography. Has a permanent spot on my front page of iPhone 7 and has been for past 3 phones ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
EDIT stick with this version unless you want to pay 3.99 a month to be able to use newest version which is subscription based now.;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
I mean you reviewers not the developers. Do you work for free They give an entire app and new features totally for free and that's still not good enough. Grow up people. Good stuff costs money, nothing new there.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
Can u add blur I'm a dancer and constantly use the app for my dance pics. Blur help take away the attention from ur sourroundings while making it beautiful. Ty;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
Having so much fun  Totally worth the purchase.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I have just spent an hour attempting to learn this app. While it does plenty, it doesn't show how to do it. Still have a photo I edited that I can't figure out how to remove.;Usa;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
Love all the tools and artistic possibilities with this app;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Very useful and easy to use. Thanks;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Time saving app adds effects, depth and texture to artwork and photos.;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
I installed this app years ago and have only used it recently.  Brilliant.  Now I have an addiction.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I love this app  the only reason I didn't give it a 5 is the fonts.. I'd like better fonts. But otherwise it's fantastic so far;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Goes in circles Can't get tutorial to start and everything else I can edit in a free program. There are no cool effects as were shown prior to purchase. Don't waste your money.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Best photo editing app I've found yet;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I've had this app for about 24 hours now as of the posting of this review and I have to say, this app means serious business. The tutorials that are provided within Enlight have helped tremendously and I'm slowly but surely getting the hang of most techniques. It's truly amazing to see how much editing you can do on your phone and how professional it comes out. ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Skip buying that burger for the day and get this app, you will not regret it one bit;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I wasted my money on this one. ;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
Editing is not as simple and intuitive as Enlight advertisements falsely lead perspective customers to believe. ;Dep;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
There is it an undo feature. ;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
The app does not pull a copy of photos in your library it will edit the original. ;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos

Once you take the time to explore all of this apps' functions, you have one powerful and creative tool between your hands. I am amazed at what I can produce. Well worth the money;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Good app. Does what it's supposed to;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
It crashes on my iPad every time now.  It used to be one of my favorites;Dep,Sup;Positive;PhotosVideos

NOT AS GOOD AS PROMOTED  SEEM BETTER TRUST ME WAS NOT WORTH 3.99 YET 1.99 ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
But unfortunately I never get to use it, because it's ALWAYS crashing. Such a bummer.;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos   
If you like to take photos, this app is a must This app rivals some the top brands. Don't be fooled by the cost.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
This changed my life..;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
I use this app so much it's ridiculous I love using it to make thumbnails for my YouTube videos My channel is  Hunter Salazar  and I make videos on spirituality and schizophrenia. This app has so many features which can greatly improve any picture you've taken from type styles to image alterations, I'd recommend this very cheap app to everyone;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
You can get in depth as you want as a beginnerstill learning photographer. I wish the developers would create a video create a video app the can do the same.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I have only had this for a little while, but I really like it. With just some basic changes it really makes my pictures pop. Looking forward to learning some of the many other features.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
This app has a lot to offer, but as a serious shooter who tries to get every last pixel exactly right it is a deal breaker that I cannot open and edit my DNG raw files without processing them to a different file type first with another app.  If I need to use a different app first then I am just going to stay in that other app.;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos   
Glad I spent the money and bought. Does all they claim it will.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
These tools really work  I love experimenting with them;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Wow Just wow This is awesome Never felt this content after buying an app This app can do anything you have in mind. And it has cool tutorials. Look forward to working with this app from now on.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I am learning more each time I utilize this, and apparently, I have lots of discovering yet to do;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
Worth my time and money;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I had an issue with the app so I left a review explaining my issue and the developer responded and gave me instructions on how to fix the issue I thought that was really awesome, considering I've never had an app do that before. My only complaint is that the tutorials in the app are a bit lacking, the developers are great at explaining things so they should make instructions more accessible within the app.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I don't normally pay for apps but this was worth it Very user friendly and has features not seen on other photo editing apps;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Hands down amazing worth the cost;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Ad made it look like this app is awesome, but after you buy it and use, will notice all the functions are not that good and are found in free apps.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
I am overwhelmed by what i can do with this inexpensive and relatively easy to use software.  I have spent hours doing something in adobe that i can do here in a few minutes.  It has many features I haven't even explored, but i will.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Very intuitive and fun. For 4 I'll get my money back for sure in just using it;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I love this app so much It's seriously amazing.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I have one request though. Maybe add a straight line in the element section so that you can straighten something out or use it to decorate something, like connecting stars to make a constellation. Anyways just wanted to say that I recommend this app to everyone and that I love this app one more time. I hope you can make this a new element Love this app;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Very powerful  When I meed more than just basic adjustments to a photo, this is what I use.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
How much money did I waste learning photoshop in college to do what this app does on my phone;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos   
It's got the right stuff but still not easy to use but it's a must Download.;Usa;Negative;PhotosVideos   
I am not a photo guy, am a major rookie and unless you have 8 masters degrees don't buy this app. Other that turning my pic to black and white, or shading it to different shades it seems to stop there.;Usa;Negative;PhotosVideos    
You can get FREE apps to do the cropping, shading, bw. Hell i think my iphone has the capability on it own. Wiptdo;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos   
A little bit of a learning curve but the more you use it, the easier it becomes, and the more impressive it is.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Its a total waste of money, app is not as great and simple like they say it is.....I WANT MY MONEY BACK APPLE;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
This is a fun app and really opens the artistic sensibility. Create your masterpieces;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
The moment I opened this app I was greeted with a friendly interface. Tapping on the various tools, I could spend hours tweaking the images with slider after slider, and after I finish one image, I'm craving the next. Not many apps can do this for such a low price of four dollars, so in my honest opinion, if you even think you love editing reality into imagination,;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I can't touch anything just tutorial and menu can't edit anything don't buy it;Usa;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
You can do some really great things with this app. It takes a little getting used to but when you get the hang of it you can do some great things. Two wishes I have one is to be able to saverecall masks. If you want the main subject and the background processed differently, you have to select the subject and do your stuff, then commit those changes and go through the making process again but inverted to change the rest. I also wish there was an option to have the mask shown as a particular color so you can easily see what is and isn't part of the mask. Overall, though, this was WELL worth the money.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Good application, but... File export controls need improvement, notably a maximum JPEG output at 100 vs 95. The additional point is to retain original file size and avoid typical IOS and app compression andor loss. Using TIFF for max file size can be overkill and then need platform to convert file to JPEG.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Im not going to make a long review. But i thought this app was free. Therefore i got it. And now im getting charged for it. Good app but im just confused;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
This is the easiest way to enhance a so, so photo and make it stellar;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I no longer need any of the photoshop apps or anything else for that matter. The Enlight app does everything I need a photo app to do and the tutorials are amazing and easy to access for all of the tools at any time I need them.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Who needs photoshop  This is EASY EASY, quick, and FUN1;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Downloaded Lightroom only to find out that you have to pay every month to use it. Sigh.... Found this app two nights ago, and WOW I can do everything I could don with LR. Haven't figured out all of the potential yet, but can't wait until I do.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Buy the app, you won't regret it.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I am still a newbie with this app and blown away by the possibilities Thank you to the developers;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
This is an amazing app I love it. I'd like to;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
have more choice to edit photos, but it has everything. I really recommend  the cost is highly. But it is really good. Love it. please add more choice to editar in the future. Thks;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Not intuitive but has many good options.  Takes time to both use and learn.  Don't expect to do much until you have mastered it.  There seems to be rather good customer support;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos    
I purchased this app thinking it was top shelf but quickly found out like most it's not worth it. I wish I could return for money back.;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
All the basic functions you can find on other editing apps. If the only thing you want is to make your pictures ridiculous then go for it.;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
I got this because I had a pic of my kid watching sea lions at the zoo but missed the actual animal. Caught it in another shot. Went looking for this because I remembered seeing the ads.;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
Merged the two pics to great effect using Enlight in under 5 minutes and I'm still learning the app. ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I just purchased based upon all the great reviews. I've played around with it a bit and it does seem to do a lot but I'm surprised and disappointed it does not allow you to flip a photo.;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
This app is great for editing pictures on the fly, basically photoshop for your phone If you've never used photoshop, don't worry this app is easy to use and you can make your pictures look really cool in just a few minutes... Buy this app, you won't be disappointed;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
So many features, gorgeous design, easy to use once you get the hang of it.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
This app has become a permanent part of my workflow for the iPhone and iPad. I will occasionally even transfer files in from my Mac and finish them off with Enlight. The interface took some getting used to but once I did I realized I could do practically everything here ;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
Okay, so my reason for 4 stars is trying to reposition the graduated line on my iPhone drives me absolutely bananas at times. On the iPad an Apple Pencil makes that easier but seriously... on the iPhone it can be pretty frustrating.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Anyway, I debated buying this for a long time because I didn't think it'd be much different from all the other great photo apps  not true;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I use this app everyday for my projects. It has everything and needs more. I especially love the easy to use platform and I'm not a graphic designer. Best Purchase ever. There should be more tutorials so I can use it in more ways.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
You can't go wrong for the price. I'm still learning and trying out new things you can do with this app. I love it;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
The best image editing app for phones I've tried. This is essentially photoshop for your phone as it should be. This is also my first time paying real money for an image editor app so I'm extremely pleased to discover it's money well spent. All I needed was a brush and a patch tool to get started on improving some phone wallpapers. I downloaded 10 free editing apps just looking for a simple brush tool. Never found it. This app had both plus more filtersimagecanvas options than I'll probably ever need. The gui is really easy to use. The tutorial screen quickly shows you how the tool you've selected works and is easy to get rid of once you find your stride.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I am so glad I got this. I can make great variations of pic editing. My husband and family love the way he he pictures come out.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
This app rivals PS Fix and in some areas is better. It took me a little time to get used to the way certain tools worked but not long. It's definitely worth the money.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
this app is so good. i just love all the different options that u have to edit your photos. when i first saw the price i thought it was ridiculous until i saw many many great reviews so i decided to get it and now i'm LOVING it. i totally recommend this app to anyone who's looking for a really nice picture editing app;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I'm having such fun playing and creating some very impressive images. I can hardly wait to master this robust app;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
So much freedom. You can do so much photo shop with this app. The zoom feature really allows you to get in the nitty gritty areas. Well worth paying for the app.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos

This has been the most difficult, just a simple text  the bottom of a flyer. It wount let me go to the bottom of the flyer with all the gadgets on the pic.... it's not on the go app.....

I would love to see more templates for BW current ones are too simple and more filters.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I wanted to love this app... Wasted money... Compared to other apps... The user interface is annoying There's smother apps out there that offer just as much for free... Don't waste your time or money on this. I gave it two stars for all the features it offers.;Usa;Negative;PhotosVideos    
This is the best photo editing app that i have ever used. It has tools that are just like photoshop. For a cheaper price;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
The best paid photo editing app I have So many features and it's easy to use. Wish there were more tutorials;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I used to used a different app until I found this one. Now I only use this app.  It is just so easy and fun to edit my photos. My only reason for not giving it 5 is the lack of ability to customize the share bar. I share my pics on Tumblr. But that's not one of the default options. Nor is it possible to add it to bar. So instead I have to go through a few extra steps for each photo. I would also like the ability to reorganize the share options to match my preferences;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Literally it's worth every penny. A very powerful app for both both beginners and experts. Infinite possibilities to tweak your photos, renders and pictures. It would be great if the app could allow you to open vector files with its user friendly interface. Great job;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Not impressed whatsoever... there are free apps that offer the same exact things this app has.  I do not recommend;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
I love this program so far so much to do and learn but easy to use;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
In love with this app. I don't know how it holds up to other editing appssoftware, but it makes a huge difference and is crazy easy to use when you get the hang of it. I was hesitant to purchase at first, but I'm sold. Definitely worth the money for a quick editing app.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Enlight is a powerful, refined tool for all photo manipulation and editing.

I'm not the best at using photo editing apps but this app is great. I'm able to create memes and add cool effects with ease.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Unless you want to spend hours trying to do something with this app you will be disappointed. Also you can do pretty much everything they do, more easily with other free apps. Completely useless;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
Seriously the tutorials help with nothing.  There is nothing to actually help you put a kid on a snail or in a tea cup like it shows in the ad.  Don't waste your time or money.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos    
I originally downloaded this app to edit some double exposures and change my snapcode color, but then I started using it for my Instagram and it took my feed to a whole new level, and I ended up gaining followers from it, this app works so well and is so user friendly once you figure it out.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I have never used an app like this, the controls are awesome.  You won't be disappointed;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos

Disappointed in this app;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
I held off on this app for years. It looked to me like a bunch of overhyped features I'd never use. Enlight ended up being the best photo editing app I've ever used and I've tried all the best ones.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Took a chance, spent the 4 and was happy with the tools and capabilities. Then tried to save the photo and lost it all. Tried again and same thing. So frustrating. Even tried emailing it to myself after the third time editing and nothing. So great editor but won't save anything so complete waste of time and money.;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos   
I have used this app since one year ago and once you learn how to use it is fantastic, but last version have a problem to open you have to tray several times and sometimes it doesn't open.;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos

A must have app if you are in to editing pictures;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
Does it all. I've deleted every other photo app.;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
I have been doing graphics design and editing for well over 20 years and this is truly my dream app. This app has taken something that has a very steep learning curve and made it ridiculously user friendly. The GUI is perfect by design. The effects are incredible It will accommodate any level user to create amazing results. You truly are only limited by your right brain creativity to produce incredible works of art. The splash screen for an image editor is the best indicator for what an app can do... And this one will not let you down;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Best picture editing app I have used on the market.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Love this app  Great work, pat yourselves on the back. Thank you;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I love this app so much, but the interface could be a little easier too access.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos   
This app makes photo editing so easy and enjoyable for me. One would be hard pressed to find a better iOS alternative.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Too many tutorials, and I still can't figure out how to do the pic that made me buy the app. Really, I want my money back. I will never use this app.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos    
No this app isn't as good as photoshop, but if you take basic photos or better use raw capture apps for your camera you can get some amazing pictures. Interface is easy to use and the only limit is your artistic ability, but even for basic users this app is great just by changing simple things like contrast brightness and white balance you can take an average photo and make it great.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I'm very experienced with photoshop and this app is more difficult and confusing than any editing software I've ever used. It seemed like it would be user friendly and useful but really wasn't the case once I tried using it. I bought the app today but I doubt I will ever use it again. I'll be deleting from my device as soon as I finish this review and continue to use photoshop.;Usa;Negative;PhotosVideos    
Really like this app so far. You can create so many unique pieces of art. Well worth the 3.99.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Enlight is complete in what's basic to photoshop images but it goes beyond the basics as well. I always start correcting my images with enlight. I love working w it.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I still learn, saw on FB tutorial but I am deaf not understand what he say, but, hope website tutorial can show you how it work will be help me or any body else deaf can understand on live video no closed caption.  but awesome almost same photoshop.. but this one little tough one..  thanks;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I have played around with the features and truly love it. Well worth the price...;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
This is a very good for editing I love it;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
It is truly the best photo editing app out there. I have used it for years now because it never crashes and always gives me the product I want. A must have for all pro photographers.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
If you like to eat mushrooms and make pictures of your friends getting smacked in the face with Filet O' Fish sandwiches, this is your goto app.  It is tons of fun.  Not good for serious design jobs, but it's a very quick way to create engaging images for blogs or Facebook dickery.  A must have.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Is there a way to get this app into a PC;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
Horrible. Complicated. Isn't what I expected. Please make it simple to use.;Usa;Negative;PhotosVideos    
My initial review was based on a bad download. Great user support, wonderful capabilities. I've not used any of my other editors since. I would give it ten stars if I could;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Lots of options. Plenty of tools. Turns otherwise throwaway photos into works or art.;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
Love this app... really enjoy the tutorials. Ive learned so many new techniques and have fun editing .... not getting frustrated ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I've used a lot of apps for photo editing and this one is by far the best with the best price. This is my go to for any editing. And if you're ever running out of ideas, their instagram page will give you inspiration to come up with something creative. All around great app;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I love the tools and feature, they give absolute attention to detail in every image. Power at your finger tips;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Amazing app. Worth so much more than its price. Editing photos is actually fun now. Currently the most important photo editing app on my phone.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
This app was great... and can be great again, it's just that now there's a glitch where if you try to add text or another photo on top of your project, whatever you're adding is blurry.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I just purchase this app minutes ago and the price shown was 3 and you guys have charged me 23.98 so which one is the right price I need my money back. Someone needs to contact me.;Dep;Negative;PhotosVideos    
Can't wait for the video editor to come out;Mis;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
I love every aspect of this app, but one issue still remains that others have also mentioned there is no RAW support. Supporting RAW really would make this the most comprehensive and capable photo editing app on the App Store, in my opinion.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Enlight is the most capable photo manipulation app available and is as significant to the iPhone as Photoshop was to desk top computing. The EDGE masking abilities separates Enlight from any other photo app, then with it's full compliment of tools, Enlight places light years between itself and it's nearest competitor. Good stuff;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I got this app two days ago, and I wasn't at all disappointed. Unlike other apps, Enlight offers a beautifully made shelf of tools, that are more like high quality toysI just can't stop playing with them. Extremely learnable, especially with well explained and, pleasingly, not a cheap set of filters and gimmicky editing tools. Enlight is the perfect tool for the iPhone photo editor. Worth every penny.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Amazing app, use it several times a day. I only gave it four stars because I believe it needs some more options. One in particular is layers. Being able to edit a certain layer after it's been set would be amazing. Other than this good app.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
The tutorials and the icons weren't very clear but after a while of screwing around with it you can do some cool stuff with it.;Usa;Neutral;PhotosVideos    
I have tried so many editing apps, but this one takes the throne. It's amazing, and it has so many options. I love the layout, and basically everything about it. More people need to know about this app.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
It's not worth the purchase. The way it functions, it should be free. ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos    
Sorry app and I haven't received my refund from this junk. I had the app for about half a day and deleted it.;Mis;Negative;PhotosVideos    
I had used this app for A year , then Lost my phone and could not remember the name of this app . I finally went back to my Facebook post for for 2015 and found where I had shared this app in a post . I'm so happy this app is Amazing and I'm so glad I have it back I use it a lot to make picture Gifts for family ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I've tried multiple photo editors on various iPhones and over time, I have found that Enlight is the best photo editor for iPhone. I'm an amateur iPhone photographer that loves using filters and having fun adjusting photos. If this sounds like you, then this is the only photography app you will ever need.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I never write reviews, but this is worth it. I saw this app on a facebook ad I usually hate ads like that, and I knew immediately that this app would replace all my other photo editing apps. It was well worth 4.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Really fun and entertaining. If you have a hard time figuring something out, it has brief tutorials in the app on how the function is used or you could google tutorials online. I searched Enlight photos online for ideas and saw some image examples and then searched tutorials on how to create those technique. And of course came up with my own. Thumbs up lol;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Loving it so far  tutorials are useful;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
Tutorial is like non existent. Hoped it would be quick and intuitive. I guess NOT. Please provide tutorials or make app intuitive.;Usa;Positive;PhotosVideos    
I liked this app until i came across a problem with the mixer tool, when sized down png files become pixelated. While i move it around the artwork its fine, but when i put it down it loses its quality. FIX IT PLS;Per,Usa;Neutral;PhotosVideos   
An amazing photo app, with the ability to do simple things and advanced things equally well, with a great UI that reveals power when you want it but only then. Definitely my go to app, displacing longliked others. Would love to see it on the Mac. ;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I use Lightroom on desktop for serious editing, but Enlight is really fun, and very able. Could be your only editor if you are not in Adobe ecosystem.;Mis;Positive;PhotosVideos   
I'm mostly happy with this app, but the recent update made changing availability a hassle to read. Why was it changed. Bring back the old way.;Usa;Positive;Business    
Since I got my new phone, it won't recognize me or my email... Which is weird, because I get emails from HotSchedules... Help I need in;Dep,Usa;Positive;Business   
I see all these bad reviews and honestly I don't see why. I was skeptical about buying the app but 2 months later I'm still loving it. I use it for the restaurant I work at and it makes everything so much easier than the mobile site. I've never had any problems and it's the best 2 I've ever spent.;Mis;Positive;Business   
This is a bad app and a bad platform. I am not using it anymore.;Dep;Negative;Business    
So since I switched to iPhone for some reason I can't select groups in messaging. I can select individual names but if I want like all the people who work in a curtain department it won't work.;Sup;Positive;Business   
The app is awesome. Very useful. However to charge three dollars and it crash ALL the time is ridiculous. Needs work.;Mis;Positive;Business    
I bought this app and it worked once. But now I can not enter. I need to use the site again to check my schedule. I'm sure my password and login are right bc I use for the site You fixed it Thank u Guys, it started lagging again;Dep;Positive;Business   
Unstable. My username and password are no good anymore. Every time it updates it doesn't recognize my password.  Garbage app.;Dep,Sup;Negative;Business   
It doesn't read well like a normal schedule and crashes out a lot. Too many mistakes can be made with it.;Dep,Usa;Negative;Business   
Used to have a problem but now it is fixed, love the app and thanks for fixing so quick y'all are a blessing that you actually listen to the people who downloaded it;Mis;Positive;Business   
This app was very useful. But after this new update it doesn't let me sign in anymore. I know my info is correct because I use it for the website perfectly fine.;Dep;Positive;Business   
Every time I try to log in after being automatically logged out for some reason the app will not let me log back in. Every time I try it says authentication error try logging in again and I do and it says the same thing. For an app I had to pay for this is extremely disappointing. Also the fact that this is the ONLY way I receive my schedule, I'm kinda screwed. If there was a way to make it 0 stars I would.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Every few updates this app stops working in not letting you log in. With the recent update I started getting errors and was unable to connect, logged out to log back in to see if that would help but now I'm stuck at the login page. When the app actually works it's very helpful but the app needs some serious help as this issue keeps happening;Dep,Sup;Positive;Business   
The new update has broken the app. Can't even sign in now. Clearly happening to a lot of users. App is useless if I have to log into the website Why did I pay for this again;Dep,Sup;Negative;Business   
The layout and general idea is good, but it logged me out and keeps showing an error when I try to log in. I can't even use it right now.;Dep;Negative;Business   
App is awesome, but the new update seems to be logging people off. This issue needs to be fixed within the next 24 hours....;Dep,Sup;Positive;Business

I've used this app for about 5 months now and it's worked perfectly fine But starting a few days ago, I was logged out and it won't let me back in Every time I try to login it says Authentication Failure, and I know I'm using the correct username and password because I went to the actual site and logged in and everything was fine.

This is a great App, when it's working It often signs me out but when I try to sign back in it keeps telling me authentication failure;Dep;Negative;Business   
The new update is horrific. It DOES NOT WORK. Mine just says it's loading forever and does not ever work.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Please add a week by week number of hours scheduled feature and the ability to view your time cards through the app;Mis;Positive;Business    
It sure would be nice if this new update still allowed me to see my schedule. Considering, HotSchedules has swindled, just about all service industry employers into using this junk.;Dep;Positive;Business    
The update has somehow remove the messages section in my app. I still get notifications for messages but I can't open them or access my messages.;Dep;Neutral;Business   
Since my application updated I have not been able to sign into the application, but my username and password works on the website so I refuse to reset my information. It would be nice to be able to use something that I paid for or give me a refund if it's not going to work and I can just use the website for free. This needs to be rectified ASAP.;Dep;Positive;Business    
My issue was resolved with the newest update and now everything is working fine Thank you;Mis;Positive;Business    
What did you screw up with messaging It's a hot mess;Mis;Negative;Business   
I had issues with my app for almost two months, called customer care as my last resort. They were super helpful, and all it took was a simple uninstall and reinstall. They guided me through every step of troubleshooting Thanks, Hotschedules;Mis;Positive;Business   
Limited functionality leaves this app overpriced.;Mis;Negative;Business    
Usually love the app but with the new update it won't open it just crashes now every time I open the app, two of my co workers are having the same problem as well I've tried deleting and re downloading the app also restarted my phone a bunch of times nothing has worked yet;Dep;Positive;Business   
Ever since the newest update this app won't open. It crashes almost instantly.;Dep;Neutral;Business   
Had to reinstall because of piss poor technical support. Was recharged for a purchase. Pound sand.;Mis;Negative;Business    
I could not log into my app after the last update. I contacted app support and the problem was fixed. So if you're having this problem I suggest that you contact them.;Mis;Negative;Business    
I love the ease of being able to just tap an app on my phone and see my schedule for the week, but the latest update has made it to where it will not let me log in, which completely defeats the purpose of having it. I hope they fix it soon;Dep;Positive;Business   
They finally fixed the log in problem, and I'm so thankful It is, once again, the second most useful app on my phone.;Mis;Positive;Business   
So I haven't been able to log in to my account and I changed the password so that's not the problem it's usually working but over the past days I have not been able to log in at all;Dep;Positive;Business   
Ever since he update I can no longer log into my account It allows me on the internet but not the app. It keeps saying authentication failure but everywhere else I can log in with no problem;Dep;Negative;Business   
I love this app, it is more than convenient The latest update logged me out and would not let me back in. I was able to log in online but not on the app. I called and it was a simple fix. If your user name has a space in it simply go online and switch you username to have no space. Example;Mis;Negative;Business   
Cannot get past login hurry  fix immediately. Via website is such a first world problem, one I will be damned if I suffice to.;Dep;Negative;Business   
After the recent update I have not been able to log into the app. I keep receiving a notification that says Invalid User Name or Password which I know is not true bc I am able to sign in on the website with the exact same credentials as the app. This is severely broke and rather annoying.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Frustrated because I can't log in. Help;Dep;Negative;Business   
Won't let me login even though my info is correct beyond frustrating having to use browser. Help;Dep;Negative;Business   
The most recent update is making it impossible to login. Unless I'm online. Please fix this issue;Dep;Positive;Business   
As of the new update I can't log into the app. It says validation error even after changing my password. The website works but the app doesn't and it is very inconvenient. Please fix asap.;Dep;Negative;Business

After I updated the app it keeps saying authentication failure even after I reset my password. I need this for work so this is ridiculous.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Everything has worked fine until the latest update where it says authentication failure even though I able able to log in with the same info on the internet.;Dep;Negative;Business

Called the 800 if your password has a special character in it that's why you can't log in.;Mis;Positive;Business    
I have had no issues with the previous versions, but since the 52617 update I am unable to log into the app at all. I can log into the website but the app says there is a validation error. I've reset my password and checked my username, but I am still unable to get into the app. I hope this gets fixed.;Dep;Negative;Business   
I cant even get in. When it first downloaded i went in and it said username and password. Thats it. No are you new or anything. I cant believe this.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Before and after updating it has been where i cant view my schedule. It says theres no internet connection, it just lists the dates. I can see online but the app isnt working. I need to see my schedule;Dep,Sup;Negative;Business   
I must say I love this app I use to hate having to create the schedules back in the day and have to have employees write it down on paper and call in to ask.;Mis;Positive;Business   
My only down fault I have is that when someone writes a message, my notifications show I have 50 or 60 push notifications. When in reality it's 5. Fixing that alone would be great.;Dep;Positive;Business   
Literally can't log in at all. So stupid, the worst right now.;Dep;Negative;Business   
This app was very useful UNTIL the latest update. This is an app that I paid for and I can't even use it now. It just won't work. Garbage.;Dep;Positive;Business   
This app makes scheduling super convenient. I can check my schedule at any time, request days off, and change my availability very easily. ;Mis;Positive;Business   
Help. There is one MAJOR flaw Login Errors. Fix it please;Dep;Positive;Business   
On a pretty regular basis, I will try to open the app and an error will appear. ;Dep;Positive;Business   
I know my password and username are correct. This app just has a lot of bugs it needs to work out. The glitchyness of the app completely defeats its purpose. Sometimes I need to see my schedule and can't because the app won't log in. Super annoying Especially because this isn't a free service ;Dep;Negative;Business   
Just use hotschedules.com.  After one software update your app can't handle my phone anymore. This is junk and wouldn't even be worth one dollar. It's not like knowing my work schedule is important or anything right;Dep;Negative;Business   
Terrible update App won't let me log in. This is very frustrating.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Can't use this app anymorenot gonna pay 3 for it. Absolute garbage, no reason to even force me to update every time by blocking older versions immediately anyway.;Dep;Negative;Business   
This is worth the 3 because it's much simpler than the site and I don't have to login every time, but it's annoying that you can't have multiple jobs on the same account. So now having two jobs that use HS, I constantly have to log out and in to the other to check each schedule.;Mis;Negative;Business   
This is a great app, haven't really had any problems with it. Easy to use and easy to understand. You can very much view your schedule at one click of a button.;Mis;Positive;Business   
I can't log in to get my schedule  After update my user name and password are not accepted. Please advise;Dep;Negative;Business   
This app is a huge waste of money. Basically all you can do is check your schedule and message, which you can do from safari on your phone and that works much better. Don't even bother with this, what a waste of money.;Mis;Positive;Business    
I can't even open the app anymore. I paid for this;Dep;Neutral;Business

Great app, but it's works only 50 of the time. Continues to say no network connection. Times when people really need it and it's important, the app doesn't work. But the other half of the time the app works great. Just please fix the other half;Dep;Positive;Business   
hi, i love using this app...when it works. it's much easier having this app and using it for scheduling. i am upset with the fact that it won't let me long in and i have reset my password;Dep;Positive;Business

We should be refunded;Mis;Neutral;Business    
I like this app easy to use;Mis;Positive;Business   
I work at two different locations at the same restaurant and it's kind of a pain to have to log into one account and log back into another, it would be nice to be able to see both places in the app instead of logging in and out constantly. That would be rad, but other than that I don't have too much of a problem. Minor things but nothing to stress out about.;Mis;Negative;Business    
Ive used this app for 4 months without a problem but after this update the login doesn't work at all, very annoying.;Dep;Negative;Business   
They have to fix this. It's unable to be used and that's unacceptable for a PAID app. C'mon HS... get it together. Fast. Please  thank you;Mis;Positive;Business   
This app was working perfectly fine until I updated it now it will not allow me to log in keep saying authentication failure which is a major inconvenience Don't forget we use this to look at our WORK schedule, this needs to be fixed asap and we PAID for this app.;Dep;Positive;Business   
Most recent update prevents the app from launching on my device.;Sup;Positive;Business

HotSchedules is a fantastic app but I noticed that in previous updates you were able to see the days you requested off but in the last two updates that features is gone, now you have to go to the time off tab to see the days you asked off before you could see you days you requested off on the my schedule tab what happened;Usa;Positive;Business   
The app runs fine on my iPhone 7 Plus. It would be nice if there weren't any load times when opening different shifts to see who's working. Also, add an earnings statement tab;Per;Positive;Business   
All of a sudden I cannot see shifts released so therefore I cannot pick them up. Also, I've sent messages and they said they have been sent but when I check later they are gone like I never sent anything Please update these problems;Dep;Negative;Business   
Cannot see anymore. Disappointed. Please fix.;Usa;Negative;Business   
Not user friendly when it comes to creating a account. I even went on my pic to look it up and it took me in circles;Usa;Positive;Business    
The HS update is awful On the off chance it actually loads, the app is slow and unresponsive. Messages don't even load. You can see the subject line and nothing else. How inconvenient is that when you need to get shifts covered and read important work messages. This app continues to be the worst app I've ever used. Especially because I need to use it daily for work. Please fix. Immediately. We paid good money for this.;Per,Usa;Positive;Business   
So it worked great... till it didn't. I tried to use the app to check on my work schedule and found out I was logged out. That was about 5 weeks ago and I haven't been able to log back into my account. I have reset my password about 57 times with no luck and when I call customer service I'm told that there's a problem with the app something I already knew told to fallow several steps to fix the issue steps that didn't do much of anything and after that didn't work told there was nothing they could do it's a BAD APP to call apple for help. Yes I liked the app when it worked and would have given it a five if it still was but it's not so it gets a one and if I could give it a negative review I would.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Why should I have to pay a monthly fee for this app to see my schedule;Mis;Negative;Business    
I just purchased the app and it doesn't work as advertised. I can only see training and settings, I can't see schedules or anything else. I would like this fixed or I need a refund.;Mis;Positive;Business    
I paid for the app just a couple of years ago  had the same email  phone number then as I do now so I am confused why I was charged again. That's why I am giving it 1 star if give zero if I could. I've never had any other app I purchased charge me twice.;Dep;Negative;Business    
Really useful app to check your schedule and pick up shifts;Mis;Positive;Business   
Current version won't show any available shifts to pick up. Other than that it's great;Usa;Positive;Business   
app doesn't work i want refund;Mis;Negative;Business    
Update is not working properly. No one can see available shifts. What is wrong with this app?;Usa;Negative;Business   
Love it Way better than the desktop version and works perfectly  just a suggestion but maybe allow us to click on our coworkers profile to see their full weekly schedule maybe even make personalized profiles to interact easier thank you;Mis;Positive;Business   
Doesn't work at all. Won't do anything ;Usa;Neutral;Business   
This app is great. It's easy to use, smooth, and has a clean interface. Worth the money, it's much easier to use than the web version. Has most of the features the web version has too.;Mis;Positive;Business   
I love everything about this app It makes everything easy and is very convenient.;Mis;Positive;Business   
You guys need to work on this app that some of us payed for... it ridiculous how it logs me out ALLLL THE TIME;Dep;Negative;Business   
I have tried multiple times to log in and I am 100 sure I have the correct email address and password because I log in to my HotSchedules account on the computer every day to check my schedule and no matter what I do or how many times I change my password or check to see if it is correct it will not let me log in. I am extremely frustrated because I paid money for this app and it's extremely inconvenient to have to go to safari or on my computer to check my work schedule. I'm fairly irritated by this and I have tried everything. I've installed and uninstalled the app and repeated this at least 6 times to see if that would help my situation and it hasn't helped at all. I'm frustrated and so far it's been a waste of time.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Still says authentication failure invalid username or password when both password and user name are correct I can sign on to the website but not this app.;Dep;Negative;Business   
I was hoping since everyone I know uses this app for work. You would be able to see how many hours you are scheduled, how many hours you actually worked, and your clock inout times. But since it doesn't it was kinda a let down.;Usa;Positive;Business    
Can't see my schedule ..;Mis;Neutral;Business   
I paid for this app and I still don't understand what to do;Usa;Neutral;Business    
The newest update won't let me login;Dep;Neutral;Business   
Is a shame that the most expensive app I own is the one that lags the most, and crashes. Fix it.;Dep,Per;Negative;Business   
I just wanna know what my schedule is. Never able to log on. Ughh;Dep;Neutral;Business   
App won't let me sign in now. I have to go through the website which only lets me log in half the time now too . Don't update;Dep;Neutral;Business   
I can't log in anymore. What a waste of money. Seriously?;Dep;Negative;Business    
The message I get when I try to log in. So far really fun that these updates seem to get rolled out around the weekend which is usually a busy time for those that use hotschedules. Just a thought but maybe a little more rigorous testing for new updates even if it's just minor improvements and maybe picking a Tuesday to roll these things out.;Mis;Positive;Business    
Did the update and now I can't even log in, says it can not authenticate the user. But when I login via the website it works just fine. Why pay money for convenience if you can't even get the darn app to work;Dep;Positive;Business    
For having paid for an app such as this I'd expect less bugs and more in app features. Being that the HotSchedules application is also a website for multiple businesses, this app should be able to make it much easier but it is in fact a larger headache than just logging in online. It forgets my password majority of the time and when I plug my proper password in it will pose an error. Becoming highly unhappy with this app. Stop the enhancements and focus on the bugs.;Usa;Negative;Business   
Can't login. Updated the app and now it won't log me in. Have to go to full website for schedule. I can log in with no problem on website. App says employee not found. Please fix asap;Dep;Negative;Business   
Updated and now it won't let me log in. Tried to reset password and it still won't let me log in.;Dep;Neutral;Business   
this new update is very glitchy and isn't working correctly;Dep;Neutral;Business   
Last update they did, killed the app.  Can't log in to it or onto their website.  Both are malfunctioning.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Some serious issues with this app right now. It doesn't work.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Can't even log in. It says can't find ID for employee yet I have my user ID and password autofilled, and I even double checked to make sure it's correct. This is ridiculous.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Update not working. Authentication error won\t login. Help;Dep,Sup;Positive;Business   
The update is messed up it had a bug please fix it because I need this for my job and it has my schedule on it fix it fast talking to the HotSchedules peopleother than the update you help a lot;Dep;Positive;Business   
I can't log into the app anymore. Help;Dep;Positive;Business   
So the app has always worked great until recently. I reset my username, and password and when I sign into the app it keeps saying Can't find employee for ID. I don't understand because when I sign into HotSchedules on the internet I login just fine. I payed for this app so I hope it gets fixed soon ;Dep;Positive;Business   
After last update the app says no network connection or when I try to access messages your user account must be assigned to ASC Hierarchy to access this page.;Dep,Sup;Negative;Business   
Seriously need to fix this app. Constant network error notifications and this app is always not opening. Displaying no employee found. How am I supposed to use this app for WORK if it doesn't work;Dep,Sup;Negative;Business   
REALLY needing to use this app today but it won't even load.  Very disappointing.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Once again needs another update, says no internet connection, when I can use any other app on my phone;Sup;Negative;Business   
It won't let me log in. It keeps telling me can't find employee id. It was just working like two days ago. This update is crap;Dep;Neutral;Business   
Can't log in with the recent update;Dep;Neutral;Business   
This crap is so aggravating I paid money for this freaking app and it should work better than the free ones. Fix it now;Dep;Negative;Business   
The app just updated itself and now i cant even log in. I tried resetting my password but it still wont let me log in.;Dep;Neutral;Business   
Every time I try to put in my login it says unable to find employee ID. I deleted the app then redownloaded it thinking that could fix it. But no. Hey, hotschedules people get to fixing it please I need it for my job;Dep;Neutral;Business   
I've had this app for years and never had a problem but after the latest update, I can't even log in anymore. I can log in when I go to the actual website though. Please fix this.;Dep;Positive;Business   
I've been using hot schedules for a year now, all my coworkers, including myself are experiencing difficulties logging on, loading schedules, swapping and etc.  please fix this. Asap;Dep;Neutral;Business    
Keeps crashing Please fix;Dep;Positive;Business   
Was the point of this update to slow everything down to the point that it's unusable If so, great job ;Per;Positive;Business   
As a side note, are you guys hiring I don't have any software development experience, but neither does your team, apparently. It will really help me out once I lose my current job because of your unreliable system.;Dep;Positive;Business    
Worse app to reply on;Mis;Negative;Business    
I got the newest update and it just loads to a blank white screen.;Usa;Neutral;Business   
App worked great until this last update, now I can't even log in.;Dep;Positive;Business   
Every single time I update the app whether it be for various enhancements or bug fixes it crashes. I just updated it again and now it's saying no internet connection even though every other app on my phone is working just fine.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Works great for work schedule and communication. However, I do wish that when I receive Messages, that it would be an actual notification instead of just a badge change. Sometimes we need quick responses and it would make it much easier.;Mis;Positive;Business   
For some reason now when I log into HotSchedules I cannot see my schedule can we please try and find a way to fix this;Dep;Positive;Business   
Every time I try to log in now, it tells me they can't find my ID which is bull because I've used this app for months.;Dep;Neutral;Business   
Just got to say this is seriously the most convenient application ever. Totally worth it.;Mis;Positive;Business   
Love this app, but since the update, I'm not getting any notifications. One of the number one reasons I use this app. Please fix ASAP;Dep;Positive;Business   
The best employee schedule app ever;Mis;Positive;Business   
I had to get this app for work when we switched from Schedule fly. While schedule fly doesn't have an app, it can be set up to send a text when a shift becomes available for pickup, and it sends texts if any message is received. In hotschedules there's no option to get app notifications or texts that a shift has been put up, the only way you can find out is to constantly open  check the app calendar. This is a huge drawback to this app for workers that like to pick up shifts. Hot schedules also only sends a text if a message from a manager is received. It does do a badge alert for coworkers messages, but it would be nice to have an option of text notifications too. Hope these options are considered for the next update;Mis;Positive;Business    
Junk. Can use only on sole employee sites. It needs to work on all sites. Please make it work on all sites.;Usa;Positive;Business   
Until this last update everything WAS working pretty well. Every time I try to approve time off or availability changes the app crashes Please fix ASAP;Dep;Positive;Business   
Very easy to use and great app overall. No crashing problems, always works and lets me know when I work. I like the sync to calendar feature but sometimes it adds it multiple times to the day. Overall nothing to complain about. I love how easy it is to view and change shifts, get ahold of coworkers and send messages through the app itself. 1010 would recommend;Mis;Positive;Business   
Cannot request specific days off. When you move to a different restaurant you have to create a whole new user name. ;Mis;Positive;Business    
Would not use this app at all. Have the restaurant print out your schedule.;Mis;Neutral;Business    
This app is really convenient for jobs and employees. One thing that would make it better is if everytime your schedule is posted, it showed how many hours you are scheduled for the week. Much more easy than me counting them up lol. Other than that, I love it;Mis;Positive;Business   
Yet another update and the app still doesn't work. It's been 7 months now and I've left a negative review everytime hoping that you would read it and try and do something about it. Apparently not. This is a joke.;Dep;Negative;Business   
This app is terrible. It constantly says I'm not connected even if Im connected to WIFI or if I'm using the web in other apps I have to use safari 70 of the time. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP;Sup;Negative;Business   
A great app for checking schedules, only problem I have is my phone language is in Japanese and since switching, the app closes every time I try to ask off. Switching back to English fixes it, but I don't want to keep it in English anymore.;Dep;Positive;Business   
Keeps me informed of any and changes to my schedule, allows me to make an easy shift change, over keeps everything organized and there isn't any chaos 5 ;Mis;Positive;Business   
This app works most of the time, and doesn't work to well with shift changing. Also the fact that you make employees pay to use this even even though the company pays a fee to use the service. Pretty sad.;Mis;Negative;Business  
Since the app updated, I cannot edit any time requests I have made.  When I click Time off  Requests and then click edit in the top right corner the app does not allow me to even click an option.  Also if I click the request shown and then click the top right corner to edit it freezes and then crashes and the app closes all together. I have tried restarting the app, restarting my phone, almost every option available but it still crashes.  Wth.;Dep,Usa;Negative;Business   
Can't edit my requests off without the app crashing. Besides that everything else works.;Dep;Neutral;Business   
I made my manager print me off paper schedules because the app forces me to update it every other week in order to see when I work Why can't I just use the older version All it does is show me times and days What bugs could there possibly be that I need to be FORCED to update the app. And I had to pay for it Thanks for nothing. Not useful.;Dep;Negative;Business   
I can't even login to the app. Thanks..;Dep;Neutral;Business   
Most of the people who use this app are servers, if I'm making 200250 a night shift, 3 is nothing. The app needs some improvement, but I'm only using it to get messages from managers and to know when I need to be in work. Which it does correctly for my iPhone 6s on 9.3.3;Mis;Positive;Business   
Updating review  Nov. 1, 2016 ;Mis;Neutral;Business

Updated review, down a star... September 3, 2015;Mis;Neutral;Business    
I've never had an app that's supposed to be used on the daily kick me off and give me error messages as much as this one. It's still incredibly frustrating to try to upon the app, in general, and get a user error message like your account doesn't exist. ;Dep;Negative;Business   
Idk if there's ever been an update where it hasn't had an issue.;Dep;Negative;Business    
This one might be the worst with the constant error messages. Please fix the issues.;Dep;Negative;Business   
I use this app for all things related to my job  shifts, messages, people's s etc... I've never had the following problem until the new update ;Dep;Negative;Business   
Every time I go to read a new inbox message, the message is blank once opened. I'll restart the app, go to the message several times, and if I'm lucky it will finally show the bodycontent of the message. ;Dep;Positive;Business   
Please fix this bc I'm missing out on important updates.;Sup;Positive;Business    
The calendar sync used to be so convenient..until it started putting in the same information twice...then four times..then seven Please fix this ASAP, I've been experiencing this for a while and it's just gotten worse over time.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Under settings every time I hit availability it just closes the app. Can you guys get your shit together and fix the issue in the app? ;Dep,Usa;Negative;Business   
I was to see how everything was going in the app, since my job use it. Saying this in the app Unable to load Settings Ownerld 1, Class com.tbr3.hs.setting. Sytrmsetting I don't know why the heck is going on. But it needs to be fix yet again. Everyone uses this app for their job. Sorry to break it to you, I wouldn't use it unless it was part of my job. And it is.;Dep;Negative;Business   
I love this app it's super easy to use and very convenient. I just wish you would add the feature to allow a profile photo cause I have hundreds of coworkers which I'm trying to remember their name or who they are but I can't put their name to a face. So it would make this app 5 stars;Mis;Positive;Business   
Ever since the last update it doesn't allow me to sign in, even though I can go on Safari or a PC and sign in fine. ;Dep;Neutral;Business   
This appwebsite is not worth it There are several other options out there for scheduling, and are completely free They recently added an update to make things more difficult, stating it's what we asked for. I'm just curious who asked for it Working on getting our company off of HotSchedules and on to better things. This app is not recommended. Keep your money;Usa;Positive;Business    
The app allowed me to sign in and worked well for a few months. Around the last update, my login started failing. The website still worked. After resetting my password, logins through the mobile app continue to fail. That's silly.;Dep;Negative;Business   
I use this for my work schedule and I really like that it syncs with my phones calendar. There seems to be a bug that sets multiple events for my one shift. For example my 11am shift shows up as 15 different events on my calendar.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Business   
Why does syncing the app to my calendar create multiple events If I'm scheduled to work 91 I have 3, 5, and even 10 events created for that one shift.;Usa;Positive;Business   
This app charged my account an incorrect amount of 12.45 and it's supposed to be 2.99;Dep;Negative;Business    
Love the app. For ur next update, I hope u can give us the option to see our schedule for more than 1 employer using hot schedule in 1 screen instead of having to sign out and sign back in.;Usa;Positive;Business   
It's annoying to flip back and forth to find out who's doing a lunch shift or a dinner shift. I'm trying to find people who aren't working to have them cover my shift  needs to be a list of who's not working this day list;Usa;Negative;Business    
Go back to the old time off request format this is terrible why fix something that wasn't broken;Usa;Negative;Business    
It's a decent set up. Some improvements could be used. As a manager I am unable to read the entire reply to notes in the logbook a must fix. It would also be nice to be able to edit staff schedules through the app and not just the website.;Usa;Positive;Business    
From the website, the new logbook set up is awful and not very functional. The old version was much easier to scroll logs and replies when scanning for specific details. It also used to put log notes in order of the time the were entered. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for the ordering now.;Usa;Negative;Business    
I would like to be able to see everyone who is scheduled to work on days that I do. For instance , I can only see people whose job title is the same as mine cashier. I want to see servers, bartenders etc as well. Please fix for iPhone;Mis;Positive;Business    
Not very versatile or functional. You can't view previous day's schedules or the weekly schedule as a whole or see the weekly schedule with coworkers. The app constantly crashes and you have to log in separately online as its a different forum than the app. The worst employee scheduling app ever;Dep,Usa;Negative;Business    
Idk what happened, but now I can't look at my schedule. It won't load and barely let me log in. You'd think an app that i paid for would work fine. Seriously hoping this gets fixed then I'll return to 5 stars because other than all of that this app was fantastic.;Dep;Positive;Business   
Can't do anything on the app anymore;Mis;Neutral;Business    
The worst app. You have to have the most recent iOS to run it, still crashes, and the browser on your phone always has difficulty loading the pages. You have to press everything twice, and trying to send messages, the text you type never shows up. I'm a very savvy, smart, phone user, and this app and website make me feel like I've never used a smart phone before. And the service isn't great either. I emailed about a problem specifically laying out my problems and got an email back talking to me like I've never used a phone before and asking me questions I had already answered. Just awful. Don't give them any more money.;Dep,Usa;Negative;Business   
With the new update the app will only let me see some HS recruiting advertisement. Upon logging out the app will now not let me log back in. Horrible update.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Ever since the new update I can't log in.;Dep;Neutral;Business   
It keeps taking me to some HS Recruit website which I don't want.;Usa;Negative;Business

I actually love this app. It's really easy to work and super convenient;Mis;Positive;Business   
This app is bd It makes swapping shifts with coworkers, requesting time off and getting my shift covered so easy.

I updated the app since it needed some bug improvements, but unfortunately it is still not working properly;Usa;Negative;Business   
Unless they work out the kinks not worth it.;Mis;Negative;Business    
Yes you can view your schedule. That's all you can do.;Mis;Positive;Business    
Messages cannot be viewed on your email. You have to log onto the app in order to view it. This is annoying. Change it.;Usa;Negative;Business    
You cannot respond to messages via email, but instead have to log onto the app and do it. This is frustrating and does not makes sense. Add feature to directly send email.;Usa;Negative;Business    
There is no personal calendar synchronization on the app that would connect app to iCalendar. Can you add this feature in the new version.  ;Usa;Negative;Business    
Mediocre project on the hot schedules team. Creates a schedule monopoly app and no competition for it hence he crap we get.;Mis;Negative;Business    
Don't know why all these reviews are saying it crashes and doesn't work I've never had a problem with my app. Very useful and worth the money.;Mis;Positive;Business   
I don't have a problem paying for apps but to pay for an app out of necessity, it has only worked for me once and I can't find contact information anywhere. I'm highly dissatisfied with this entire experience.;Mis;Negative;Business    
I paid for this and with this new update all it does it crash and will not let me see my schedule. It only offers me settings and training. And no other screens. I do not buy apps. This is the only app I've paid for on this phone.;Dep;Negative;Business   
Thank you for not making this app crazy experience like other ones and thank you for the amazing workout. I waited a long time to find something that I could do in less than 10 min a day before my girls wake up in the morning.

i bought this app and it works great, but once you open the app, it will tell you that it will not be compatible with iOS 11 until the developer fixes the app. if the developer does not fix the app in time the software update comes, apple will pull the plug. so, don't buy this app until iOS 11 comes and if it's still there. otherwise, money will go down the drain.;Sup;Positive;HealthFitness

I love everything about this app The research behind the program gave me the confidence to try this exercise program. This app has excellent exercise tutorials  the 7 minute workout is perfect for my busy scheduled life I also love the little extra motivation to work out daily to achieve the free app sessionsworkouts  The only reason I might of given a 4 out of 5 Stars is that the developer needs to update the app to the new IOS phones.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
Very userfriendly  It explains and demonstrates the exercises well.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
Love the app, it works like a charm However phoneapp tells me it will not work with the current update of iOS. Please update the app to maintain compatibility otherwise people are going to be asking for refunds Mind you, I just installed the app today. It works fine now, but since I paid for it I would like it to work and work properly until I choose not to use it anymore.;Sup;Positive;HealthFitness   
Buyer bewareBecause this app is running on a 32 bit and hasn't had an update in 2 years it slows down my iPhone 7plus. I've been charged for this app and now can't even use it.;Per,Sup;Negative;HealthFitness

Great plan.  Helps me get a sweat and a quick workout in  Please update so it will work with upcoming ios 11 update  Thank you;Sup;Positive;HealthFitness   
I love this application so much, and it's helped me to begin to work out more. I was a bit skeptical of how well this app would work, and how intense the workouts would be. But, after doing my first workout alongside the app, I knew it was going to be very helpful. Essentially, it guides you and helps you to complete your workout, much like a personal trainer would. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to workout, but finds it difficult to do so without the guidance of someone else. Please update this application so it won't get deleted after iOS 11 I want to continue using this app.;Sup;Positive;HealthFitness   
Make the app 64Bit for iOS 11 please. How can you make apps and not support all platforms.;Sup;Neutral;HealthFitness

This app hasn't been updated in years. On startup there is a warning that the app will stop working in future versions of iOS. For now it's great but you may want to think twice before spending any money on this app.;Sup;Positive;HealthFitness    
It's unfortunate this app seems to have been abandoned, because it truly is the best 7 minute workout app. 1star for being obsolete, 5stars for being an excellent exercise app  3stars overall.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness

I see that according to Apple, this app slows down my phone and may not work in the future if not updated. Last update over 2 years ago  Do I need to go ahead and find another workout app or nah Please update because I don't like apps that slow down my phone. And as you know there's plenty of apps this one is my primary one for now The interface could stand an upgrade or two. But the app is functional and holds user accountable. I like the achievements for working out consistently or more than once a day. I like the chart where you can see how your weight changes.;Per,Sup,Usa;Positive;HealthFitness

I've been using this app for the past two years and it's been a great investment. All the workouts are easily doable with minimal accessories.  One quibble it's been exactly two years now without an update from the developers. This is app ranks as the 18th most popular paid app on the store, so I'm at a loss as to why there is no development support for this app. There are compatibility issues to remedy and a few bugs to squash. For example, daily reminders from the app to schedule a workout are now nonfunctional. Come on guys;Usa,Sup;Positive;HealthFitness

To be honest, this is the best workout app I've gotten. It works great I'm not really trying to lose weight or anything, but to beef up on muscle. Before I got this app, I was pure skin and bones, no joke, weighing around 110 pounds 16 years right now I did have love handles, ugh After two months of doing a circuit each and every day, I have burned a lot of my love handles and have gained lots of muscle. My abdomen is more visible and I can finally see myself flex  I've unlocked three bonuses and I do 4 out of the 5 workouts a day. At first, it was just the first until I unlocked the other ones for free Time for the last workout to be unlocked I'm not shredded or anything, at least not yet, but I do feel more healthier and stronger thanks to this amazing app.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness

Seems fairly easy and simple. Will be good for in between the gym.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
After trying many of the other 7minute workout apps, I conclude that this one is my personal favorite, note the personal. Most of the other one require you to pay for other features when this app gives it after the initial purchase. The workout itself is amazing because I can keep my device turned off and the workout will still continue. The addons in this app are also great, but I feel like the initial workout is enough. The reasons why I gave this a 45 instead of a 55 is because of the lack of updates and the improvements there could be on the app to accommodate more recent devices, like the iPhone 6 or 7. Since it is out of date, the app drains a bit more battery on newer devices than it does on older ones your device will send you a notification of this issue when using the app as a reminder. In the end, this is a very good app for those who, like myself, do not have the time to workout for long periods of time in an expensive gym. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone.;Per,Sup;Positive;HealthFitness   
Don't work with 10.3 no more please update;Sup;Positive;HealthFitness

The App developer needs to update this app for compatibility. After clearing the prompt, I received another popup saying Rate our app Rating the app helps us make free updates  I thought paying for the app allowed the developer to make updates, which is why it was disappointing to be hit with these two prompts. For those considering a purchase, wait until the developer makes one of those promised free updates to improve compatibility. Hopefully this review will help them do that.;Per,Sup;Positive;HealthFitness    
The iWatch version does not work at all   I contacted the developer 48 hours ago. If I don't get a response within 24 hours please refund my charges. Really dissatisfied with the service and your lack of support.;Sup;Negative;HealthFitness    
It's great for at home workouts As a stay at home mom this is great for short exercises to keep you active and tone;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
This app already looks pretty promising and very simple to use I think I can get started and get your sweater and actually enjoy it it beats paying for a gym membership now especially with insane annual fees at Jim's and monthly rates that are just horrible so I'm hoping that this actually works out for me it looks pretty cool;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
Loved it. Got my pulse up and my 15 year old son even enjoyed it.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
Please update the app's compatibility so that it doesn't make the iPhone's iPhone 7 run slow. Please and thank you;Per,Sup;Positive;HealthFitness    
This app is great to get you motivated and easy to build upon. Love the daily progress tracker too;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
I've been using this app twice daily 5 times a week and can definitely tell the difference.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
7 minutes really It went by so quick My wife was watching the kids in the tub and I popped in a fast work out, so simple. Only issue why I have it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the alarm won't work to prompt me to remember. I set a phone alarm instead. Great app;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness  
Like having a personal trainer at my constant disposal. I'm on the go with business and travel and this app keeps me active when otherwise I would not be. Great value.;Mis;Neutral;HealthFitness   
Drains my battery but it's a great motivator;Per,Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
I was a little nervous in buying this, simply because so many apps can be a disappointment. This application is amazing. First use of it, and man oh man.... I love this and look forward to my 7min work out everyday.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
Haven't used it yet, so hoping it motivates me;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness    
The app gives you 12 basic workouts that I get for free if I tell Amazon echo to to a 7 minute workout. You can get these simple workouts free from anywhere. Thought there would be music or a person helping to coachurge you along even if only a video. DO NOT BUY. Read all reviews or at least find other bad ones to realize they're gaming the system with fake reviews or bribing users to favorably review by giving out the upgraded workouts.;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness    
At 50, this is perfect. This app will helps to motivate me to start exercising It's the perfect 7 mins, not too long, but more than enough to get the heart rate up and get me back on track ;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
Great workout when you're short on time. Easy to do when traveling;Mis;Positive;HealthFitness   
Current temperatures way off at times. I don't know why it shows inaccurate temperature. Make it reliable.;Dep;Neutral;Weather   
So close but just not enough. Enticing and that can be very , let me repeat this ,;Mis;Neutral;Weather   
Inaccurate, very poor radar feed. Fix it.;Dep;Negative;Weather   
It's so slow that the storms have passed before the loop loads.  Get it fixed please;Per;Positive;Weather    
I love storms, but I can't call myself a true storm chaser. I'm more of a convenient storm chaser. So, it's great to see storms nearby. However, I also ride my bike around town. So, this helps for planning. It also tracks storms overseas, and that is helpful when I happen to be traveling abroad.;Mis;Positive;Weather    
The general information is ok, but even after setting all the correct information for notifications, I get absolutely no notices of severe weather, lightning, or even rain coming. I paid for the app and I really regret it. No help from the company either. The Weather Channel app is so much complete, and very accurate.;Dep;Negative;Weather   
With notifications turned on I have other apps that give more notice more often. Not worth the cost.;Dep;Positive;Weather    
Great app. Works very well wherever your at.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I was never really happy with this app.  It is slow and cumbersome at best.  I have two other radar apps that are a lot better than this.;Per;Positive;Weather   
Free NOAA shows clear skies. My other apps thankfully were more accurate. I cannot trust this app. Provide more accurate information.;Dep;Positive;Weather   
I'm not sure this is a good app it will take further review to actually tell.;Mis;Positive;Weather    
Pretty reliable compared to other apps out there. I tend to get notices quicker form your app than my other weather apps.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
Replaced another weather app with this one. So far works very well.;Mis;Positive;Weather    
This App was last Updated on December 16 2016... Please provide a new version. We need update.;Sup;Positive;Weather    
Not user friendly interface with Updated Operating Systems. Bring back the old UI,;Usa;Positive;Weather    
Provides the level of detail needed for weather awareness  well done;Mis;Positive;Weather   
Shooting in the Rocky Mountains the weather is very unpredictable. I was told about this app by a friend and it has become invaluable when making sure the area we're shooting in is free of storms or heavy rain.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
This app is certainly going to replace any opportunistic weather app that has come before it and I can't really imagine one topping it for years to come. Plain and simple. It's that good.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
Great smooth radar and local info as you travel.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
It can't predict bears, but it can keep you safe from unexpected weather.  If you run for 60 minutes, know what to expect.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I'm a bit weather obsessed, and ha e used several different apps ... this one is the most satisfying and easy to use.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
The app is great Would recommend to anyone who wants up to date weather radar..;Mis;Positive;Weather   
The app only seems to go back in about 45 minutes. I need something to see the last couple of hours of pattern. And it also does not do any projections of the next couple of hours. Not very useful in my Opinion;Mis;Positive;Weather    
Very clunky and often just incorrect info.  There are much better apps for weather. I like Radar Scope and Wunderground weather.;Usa;Positive;Weather    
App needs serious improvement. Will not find my location showing at least 160 north of actual location. Radar is cheesy at best, poor refresh rate, very slow  inaccurate also.  Don't think that the screen shots on app are a fair representation of what you get with the app. Weather channel app is head and shoulders above the junk.;Dep,Per;Positive;Weather    
Over priced and poor performance vs other free apps. Uninstalled;Per;Positive;Weather    
Disappointing really feel it should be as good as I get on the iPhone, but even with Retina display it is less  I'm bummed.;Usa;Neutral;Weather    
Since I'm not always available to get the news program, it's wonderful to be alerted when storms are headed your way. Thanks for being here;Mis;Positive;Weather   
Exceptional performance and information.;Mis;Neutral;Weather   
Forecasters do a great job in giving a headsup on tropical and local weather.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I like the app. The color radar is excellent. I like the information I receive with the notifications. However, the notifications in severe weather are not timely. For example, I will have gotten several alerts from another weather app before I receive even one from this one. I live in central Ga. we get some pretty bad storms in the spring and summer. I don't know why this is the case but if the timeliness of the notification can be corrected I would rate as 5;Per;Positive;Weather   
Can't even detect my location;Mis;Neutral;Weather   
What a great way to observe the weather.  It is difficult for me to get what the weathers going on, here at the location that I'm at.  Now all I have todo, just get the weather issues right here;Mis;Positive;Weather    
Love interphase and the use of colors. Great app. And weather freak and  love it;Mis;Positive;Weather   
App is slow at loading. There are so many weather apps out there.  This should also show you the direction the storms are moving. Please add this feature.;Per;Positive;Weather    
This app is easy to customize with trustworthy weather based on solid science.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
As with all good apps, it can get a need for software updates. This app is good quick source to learn about possible weather threats to Hawaii without going to local news sources and bearing with heavy advertising. Cost of pro version is minor compared to the advertisements.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I like this app because it tells me where the storms are and where they are likely to go.  And they send me notifications when things change.   It is exactly what I need. Neat and simple.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
They did a update to this app. And to say they screw it up would be a understatement , not only would I not recommend this app. At this time until they get their together, I am dropping it from my iPad.;Sup;Negative;Weather    
If another noaa radar app wasn't out there offering heaps more functionality for a similar price then I might give this app more stars. Currently I can not find a feature in this app that offers layouts for a temperature map, wind speed, water temperature, and even a storm path layout, as is available in another app similar to this one. All I see is the option to view information for specific locations by enteringtapping around a location. The only layout I can find is storm coverage by layout I dont mean satellite view.. Sad to see this app charging people over 4 3.99 at 30 off for what Notification functionality ;Mis;Negative;Weather    
On the other hand the widget and notification features are a strong point in this app.. But notifications require location services to be ALWAYS ON and as you see on first opening the app their is a big fat privacy star next to this. If your fine with your location being used for ad content then you might not consider this a con. ;Dep;Positive;Weather    
Anyways I hope apple doesn't decide to hide this under the thousand or so other reviews this app has like it does with all my reviews.;Mis;Positive;Weather    
Updated review As you can read below, I loved this app. Unfortunately, it hasn't been updated in ages but main issues are with accuracy. It's pouring outside yet no alert, and app says otherwise. Another ex of this is fact I own both weather live as well as this app both from same developer yet info varies dramatically. Temperatures shown up to 10 difference, and neither seem to agree on anything. I'm hoping this will be fixed in future. Apalon is a great company and I own most of their apps. I just hope the apps aren't abandoned. ;Dep,Sup;Positive;Weather   
I haven't found an Apalon app that disappoints yet. This one is no exception. Easy to use  customize.;Mis;Negative;Weather   
Good map. Notifications are slow. I don't want to wait too long before I am notified.;Per;Positive;Weather   
This is a lifesaver for folks like me doing lots of outdoor work I appreciate the pinpoint accuracy.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
Easy to use  Great for parents who want to track weather in multiple college towns.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
App is ok but not nearly as good as Storm was. What they did with Storm was a crime. We've taken a big step backwards.;Mis;Negative;Weather    
I've had this bundled pay app for several years.  The very recent upgrade is terrible.  I can't suggest an alternate weather app to purchase but this one is no longer on my refer to a friend list.  Maybe a market research panel could come in handy.;Mis;Positive;Weather    
Radar showed no rain as it was coming down cats and dogs for 2 hours, and the forecast said 0 chance of rain. Why is the forecast wrong? Fix;Dep;Negative;Weather    
Ultimately it rains pretty good for 5 hours, plenty of time to correct the forecast but it was still incorrect.;Dep;Positive;Weather    
The Free ones are better. This one I paid for and it's to far behind and doesn't show in the yellow or red when it's raining very very hard...It was raining so hard and never left the green area...l'm in South Florida so I like up to the min reports..Just not worth paying for this...but I hope it improves because I love the layers with this one.;Dep;Positive;Weather    
Delayed and inaccurate in my area but the app and graphics are nice. I paid for this version that's the disappointing part. Please make it more accurate.;Dep,Per;Positive;Weather

Not easy to assess info. Too many banners, pins, extraneous clutter to get immediate info I want. Needs a major user interface change;Usa;Positive;Weather    
I haven't been using the app very long but love how simple and fast it is.  I also enjoy they fact that it is add free and doesn't have all the special interest videos bogging down the app.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
Slow and inaccurate it has my area as Stewart, Alabama. We are Winfield city, in Fayette county, community if BOBO. Has always been that NEVER STEWART. Correct this asap.;Dep,Per;Neutral;Weather   
Better than most weather apps I have tried. Straightforward. Clean graphics.;Mis;Positive;Weather

Great radar add the pin drop weather is great for where your going to;Mis;Positive;Weather   
Love how the maps are only ever a couple mins behind current time and are always updated in real time. The design, look, and feel of the app is the best;Mis;Positive;Weather   
Real time weather radar that is great and more comprehensive than other radar apps.  Nice alert choices that can be turned offon to your liking.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
Location names are inaccurate. Can't find how to edit. Not enough accurate info. Waste of 3.99. Expected better. Developers need to solve these issues. Or don't buy ;Dep;Positive;Weather

Great app, worth the price to be ad free. Lots of features and easy to customize.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I have used several weather apps and this has become my favorite. I might suggest that you make a button people can use to find out more info on how this works as there are some things available in the app that you otherwise have to find out by yourself.;Usa;Positive;Weather   
This has been great, accurate and quick reports, accurate radar.  It has been great to use.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I updated app on 71717.   A fantastic app was destroyed by the update.  My saved locations were deleted, new icon for a save location is so big it blocks radar. Weather fetching feature is gone.  The map overlay won't save. All of the good things I paid for in the old app are gone and not available.  Do not update;Dep,Usa;Positive;Weather   
Great tool for anyone;Mis;Positive;Weather

I love this weather app I have the hardest time w inaccurate radar and temps. This app is user friendly, high tech, and very very accurate.;Mis;Positive;Weather

Perfectly accurate, love the option to put your own input in, slightly difficult controls but you get the hang of it;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I bought this app because we go boating and we watch the weather. It doesn't do anything different than the free weather channel app does. It's also confusing wanting you to layer things. I wouldn't recommend it.;Usa;Positive;Weather    
Definitely the best weather app I've bought and used. Worth every dollar;Mis;Positive;Weather   
Great app that's very reliable;Mis;Positive;Weather   
Radar Pro is free and much better. This expensive piece of garbage has next to no settings and does not show current radar for our fast moving Arizona monsoons. Want my money back If you want a good one, get Radar Pro for free;Dep;Positive;Weather    
The radar on this app is horrible quality. The app doesn't even show up in my list of apps in order to try and get a refund back. App was not what I thought it was going to be;Mis;Negative;Weather    
I have 9 different weather apps installed on my phone and this one is better then the rest at this time. I do know that with every weather app updates are needed or the technology has some hiccups. When weather apps have hiccups for too long I uninstall those apps and give them another try after a long period of time. This app is awesome. I have two NOAA apps on my phone and they are solid performers. Great work keepitup ;Mis;Positive;Weather   
Not sure if location is being detected. Please fix it;Dep;Positive;Weather   
I like this app because it gives you a progression of the frontsstorms. I have four weather apps and this one is the best.;Mis;Positive;Weather   
I had this this app in the FREE version for quite some time. It worked great. So I decided to pay for the full version. It no longer shows weather directly overhead. It only shows huge storms. If a storm is small...it doesn't show up at all I live in Tampa, Florida. We get hit almost every day with severe and close to severe storms in the summer. What a disappointment. Like everything else these days.;Mis;Positive;Weather

I use radar everyday on the water for work. Any number of reliable free weather radar apps are better then wasting your money on this garbage. Yea its a weather radar, yea it works, but do yourself a favor and save a couple bucks and stick with weather bug.

My local 600 am weather report has forecast scattered showers throughout the day, but it's now 100 pm and my dog would like me to take him for a walk. I patiently explain to him about the possibility of scattered showers, and he in turn asks me to check out the NOAA radar app. The radar map shows clear skies for the next two hours, so we are off to mark every tree in in the neighborhood once again. How handy is that I do not actively participate in the marking ritual,;Mis;Positive;Weather   
Love the accuracy and up to date weather;Mis;Positive;Weather   
This app is great. The only glitch I have found is when you track lightning. If you want to zoom out, it won't zoom out with the lightning bolts. They kind of freeze on the screen and and move wherever you're trying to look. I don't think I explained it well but that's the only issue I have. Other than that, it's a great app;Dep,Usa;Positive;Weather  
I love the app. It keeps me in the loop of what's happening or going to happen..just wish it had lightning strikes on it..but I do like it a lot. Thanks.;Mis;Positive;Weather

I'm very happy with this product the way is it and others, when searching through bad weather situations and possible cyclonic activity in this area. It is very useful in times when we have no power or no cable I do recommend anyone living in a high weather damage area to be completely relieved to have found this app and use it with very little difficulty.;Mis;Neutral;Weather   
Other FREE apps do a much better job of getting you updates.  Also the radar is inferior to other free apps.;Mis;Positive;Weather    
I still regret paying for this thing It has never worked. Either fix the app or give my money back.;Dep;Negative;Weather    
I works fine. You may get more pinpoint information if you subscribed to your nearest TV stations weather alerts.;Mis;Positive;Weather    
This version is all messed up. It gives a current temp of 90 for my city but lists the high for the day as 82. It is barely 7980 right now so this is no longer a trustworthy app.;Dep;Positive;Weather

This is a nice weather app. I bought it because I guess I thought the radar feature would be superior to my existing goto weather app  but it's really not.

I have to say that after using this app compared to the multitude of other weather notification apps that I have, I am not impressed at all. I live in Savannah, GA where we get some pretty bad weather from time to time and I like to know when that weather is on my back door. Just recently we had a mild tornado outbreak, as well as a slew of severe thunderstorms. Of all of the apps that I have for weather with the notifications turned on, NOAA was the very last app to give me a notification that the storm was happening, and at times that notification was almost an hour after the storm had passed. If this was the only app that I had giving me notifications, my family and myself could have wound up seriously injured or worse if just one of those tornado producing storms had hit my house and I was relying on this app. The sad thing is that this is a paid app, that I purchased for a little bit of reassurance during bad weather to give me some piece of mind and the only thing it has done is make me more weary about severe weather in my area. And for anyone that reads this and is wondering, this has not been the only time that the app has been extremely delayed in letting me know that there was bad weather approaching. It happened in April, as well as January, during the tornado outbreak across GA. So basically, it's not a fluke.;Dep;Negative;Weather

I've used Storm ad free weather many years until now because ad free is no longer available. NOAA Radar Pro had great reviews so I plunked down 3.99 and got it. Well, here I am in Tropic, Utah and the temperature reports are approximately 10 degrees off. It repeatedly is reporting the daily high of the day in the mid 60's when the actual temp is actually in the mid 70's or higher. I should add that Storm is reporting the correct temperature. Back to Storm I go, being bugged by ads but at least I get the correct weather reports. There goes 3.99 down the toilet and no way to get a refund.;Dep;Positive;Weather

We have contacted this app provider before and we are still getting inaccurate reports for our area. A huge storm passed through at 100pm today with major flooding and as usual, we just got a notice for heavy rains and a flash flood warning almost 5 hours late. We are on the southeastern coast near Charleston SC. My friends who have this app say it is inaccurate most of the time as well. When Matthew came through the weather report was clear. We have tried switching the location service off and rebooting as well as trying wifi and cellular service both off and on. But we still get warnings for the Pacific coastline and Pacific weather. Don't know why they can't locate us and give accurate weather.;Dep;Positive;Weather

This app has always had two significant issues that make it impractical. 1. It always starts incredibly zoomed in, meaning you have to pinch zoomout several times to see incoming weather. I don't know about you, but I can usually tell if it's raining at my current location by opening my eyes. I need to know what's on the way, not what's already here. 2. When you begin zooming out, your city's name pops up in a bubble that covers the city and, in my case, a significant portion of my state. This blocks my view of the weather itself. And I live in a rather large Midwestern state, so it's ridiculous that the city name scales larger and larger as you zoom out, covering the state. It's just bad design, and I don't know why no one else is bothered by the poor functionality and lack of customization. This isn't worth 4.;Dep,Usa;Negative;Weather

The radar has changed a lot from the prior edition. In the prior edition, you could click to show storm chases I am a chaser. I used this app daily to see where the other chasers were. Now you don't have the option. Also the map had more informative info such as small towns. This new map isn't worth the 3.99. Very disappointed.;Usa;Negative;Weather

Here's today's forecast from another popular app 'Cloudy skies this morning followed by thunderstorms this afternoon. A few storm may be severe.'  This app '.......'. That's right it doesn't give you a forecast for today. And if I hadn't watched the weatherman this morning I wouldn't know today has the potential of having a severe weather outbreak. Forecasts for days in the future consist of two words at most. Inexplicably Saturday is forecast as 'Clear.' But the chance of rain is 70. Tomorrow shows 'Light rain.'  Chance of rain, 0. Makes no sense. Why this app gets such a high rating is a mystery to me. If you live an area where severe weather is common don't get this. Even if you don't it's poorly done.;Mis;Negative;Weather

I didn't realize this app requires an internet connection to be useful. Sure, it can do simple stuff like 123 without an internet connection. But I can do that in my head. I thought I would be able to use it to calculate derivatives and integrals offline, when I don't have access to the WA website. That would have been useful and I would deserve a 5star review.

I wouldn't guess in 34 weeks why it has high ratings, does really nothing, and I'm not even saying better or different from regular search, gives you some silly mostly useless stat. Furthermore, inputting can't perform any 2 or multipleword search, if its not already inputted I mean, gets you an error with mean options to choose one of words from many inputted, combine couple and you get error again. Several other things, not even worth mentioning, no zoom, etc. And, its pricey too and inapp purchases to add photo check, etc. Not worth having on your phone, I'm deleting it;Dep,Usa;Negative;Reference    
The app doesn't give you useless data, making it a streamlined way to search for random questions that enter your head.

I love Wolfram Alpha This app has a brain of its own. It helps me with anything I need to know. From math to history, it will have the answers I need.  What makes it even more amazing is that it is you can use the normal free version on the desktop or you can use the proversion on that will show your work providing you pay. All in all, this is an amazing app and I recommend it to anyone attending school or who wants to broaden their knowledge.;Mis;Positive;Reference

I've been a fan of Mathematica since 2005, and this app is a nice way to ask any question which has an answer containing mathematical content including just numbers. It's a little finicky at times but will tell you to rephrase your question so it can understand. I've recommended this app to college students as an alternative to looking in the back of the book or solutions manual. It almost always gives the asker much more than they would need and is a superb educational support tool. The best part of it is it's incredible value. It costs little but is loaded with information and could not be a better value for the money.;Mis;Positive;Reference

This has helped me pass Calc one through Calc three. The step by step integral calculator is just amazing. I used to have to google search each integral and hope someone solved it in order to find the steps but with this it's like a personalized tutor.

Wolfram Alpha has been helping me learn math and solve problems for over a year now, in addition to being to being the ultimate knowledge power in the universe sorry, Imperials, not even the Death Star can top this one. It's helped me all the way from my geometry and algebra classes in high school, up to trig and engineering calculus in college with stepbystep instructions for many of those problems you just can't seem to work out on your own. It also integrates with Siri, and knows that the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything is exactly 42. To any broke college student out there with a math class  forgo a cup of Starbucks coffee, a snack from a vending machine, or a beer, and invest in your education instead. You won't regret it.;Mis;Positive;Reference   
Just a few hours of searching around on this app has completely blown me away. I am a senior in high school and strongly recommend this to any and all high school college students.

Rather than googling for the specific question or going on a math forum, you can simply plug in your equation, wait a couple seconds and bam you got your answers and it will show you explanations on how to do it. I'll be going off to college next fall so hopefully it will still be useful then.;Mis;Positive;Reference

With all the lights in the city, the sky isn't as dark as it is in other places.....this helps to differentiate what I'm looking at.;Mis;Positive;Education    
I love this app. We are full time RV and love to see the stars at nite. With this app we know just what we are looking at as we move around the country and the sky changes above us. With the calendar we can see when the ISS or planets will be in our view along with comets or meteor showers. I also love the red light at nite with the sky view. Too cool;Mis;Positive;Education   
I have used this app for years, and it always amazes me.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is a great app for anyone wanting a look at the night sky The only thing I would change would be that one should be able to point ones phoneiPad at the sky and the app would tell you what you are looking at. Otherwise, great app;Mis;Positive;Education   
Have had this app for over two years. It is awesome. My children and I love to sit in the yard and watch the night sky in awe of all the marvels we are learning about.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Stargazing with the help of this app is the most wonderful way to look at the heavens ;Mis;Positive;Education   
I love this app. Sitting out on a summer evening, it really helps me know what's happening out in space. Very user friendly;Mis;Positive;Education   
It's great to have this app but how do I find the Milky Way or go beyond are solar system;Mis;Positive;Education   
Simply the best app of its kind.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is without a doubt one of my favorite apps. I have used it all over the world. People are always amazed by it.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is a great app Others try to duplicate, yes I've tried others and sad about it, but they have not even come close. Lack some personal touch. A this one, I give;Mis;Negative;Education   
Loads quickly with accurate sky map. Interactive information is great. Notification of events in local sky are a plus.;Mis;Positive;Education   
As an astronomer on Maui, I share the sky with many visitors. The only app I show my guests is Star Walk. I have tried them all and it is the best. Many people buy it on the spot during my tours They love it too;Mis;Positive;Education   
I have had this app. For about four years and although I have tried others I continue to go back to this one. They let you know when something visually coming up to see, like meteor showers are able to view and the graphics are awesome. For anyone interested in looking up, I say get this one, you won't be sorry.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is an amazing app.  I used in on the charter sailboat I ran and showed people all the constellations and planets, well worth the money   Thank you;Mis;Positive;Education   
Calibration does not work right on the update version, glad I kept an old version on an old iPad. Also, the date doesn't always work and I have to manually change to the correct day. Otherwise pretty nice, but why are updates always worse on apps;Dep,Sup;Neutral;Education   
Very educational , love the gallery of photo's too.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is a great app. Use it all the time when on Boy Scout camping trips.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Not very friendly calibration always off harder to use than older version but it does have more info than before. It's just ok for me;Dep,Sup,Usa;Positive;Education   
It has been working fine with my Apple air 2, even with the latest update love the graphics. You can click on a planet and spin it around with your finger. You even can see the other side of the planet, you can line up with you camera and find a consolation with the gyro effect in your house. Have fun every one, you don't find the  planet earth because you are on  planet earth.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Don't waste your money;Mis;Positive;Education    
Been using this app for a number of years.  Always interesting.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I recommend this app for anyone who has children andor an interest in astrology;Mis;Positive;Education   
I've had this for years, and love it. I use it to time when I leave to photograph the sunrise or sunset. I've taken it camping and the kids always love it thanks very much.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This app is why I bought an iPad in the first place.  I love the app, how you can see the stars day or night or below the horizon and through the earth.  I have a much greater sense of the location of planets and constellations in relation to the earths daily, monthly and yearly rotation.  Even if there is overcast, the sky is visible.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Love viewing while out camping Gods handy work is amazing We use this program with visiting Chinese students and they are blown way.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Wonderful learning tool and star gazing companion. Must have iPad app.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Very frustrating. No matter what icon I press, screen goes crazy. Fix the problem.;Dep,Usa;Negative;Education   
Just intro Screen and noise.  No ability to see behind it.  I am going to delete if its not fixed soon.;Usa;Neutral;Education    
The best and most useful of all my apps. It's unbelievable, the things it can do. It blows my mind while blowing all other apps out of the water. I love it. Adolf;Mis;Positive;Education   
This has been a great find for a newbie like myself. It has helped me to learn the night sky. I really like having the visual magnitude setting. I use it to show just the higher magnitude stars which helps to simplify the star field making it easier to recognize constellation patterns.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This was the first app I bought for my original iPad in 2011. just upgraded to the iPad Pro and it hasn't lost a beat. Still looks gorgeous. And it again was the first app I down loaded. It's like my refrigerator door. The doorway to quenching my thirst;Mis;Positive;Education   
I bought this app because I really wanted to know what I was looking at in the night sky.  There are many extras with this app that makes it worth the price. I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about the stars, planets and satellites.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I got this app about 56 years ago and I watch the stars every night. Love this app.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I got this app about 5 yrs ago and it's one of the best apps even still today. Make sure you turn on the notifications. When something like 2 planets being close together like tonight it's Jupiter and Venus and Mercury not far away, your notified of the occurrence. You can zoom in and do screen shots. I love this app and found it when I did a search of Editors Choice way back when and its still amazing Just get it I know this one was free when I got it but don't know if it still is, but if you can't decide which of the Star Walks to get, I prefer this one the best. Can't improve on PERFECT;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is a great app to learn about Astronomy. If you have ever wondered what those celestial objects are in the night sky on any given night at any time, it's not a mystery anymore. Tons of information at your fingertip  Thanks Vito Technology;Mis;Positive;Education   
I've used this app for the last 6 years  It is the one I choose over my 3 options nearly anytime I view the heavens.  The music entrances me soothing life stressors out of mind.  I've not experienced any trouble using this app, ever.  Worth paying for this extraordinary app from an outstanding developer.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This App is amazing. Cool sound effects when you touch the options just put it over the top. HD pictures and moving objects are so clear. Out of all the Apps I have downloaded this maybe the 1 coolest one.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I have used this app for about 4 years. Simply amazing. Gorgeous and informative graphics.  Easy interactive viewing.  Never crashed.  Always accurate.  Highly recommend.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Just got a push notification with an advertisement for star walk 2. If they start using this app to push dump ads to my phone, I'll delete them. Not cool.;Mis;Negative;Education    
I enjoy this app immensely.  It was one of the main reasons I decided to get an iPad.  Sky live all the time.;Mis;Positive;Education   
There is nothing better than to go out in the back yard and turn Star Walk on, listen to the katydids and watch the stars float across the sky. Wish there was a 10 star rating;Mis;Positive;Education   
I chose this app on a hunch 5 years ago and it is a delight. I am not an astronomer so I had no selection criteria so I got the app on a hunch. I love it. My wife and I lay on lounges when we are in the desert and are amazed to have a guide to the sky. Don't hesitate;Mis;Positive;Education   
Love it, use it all time. This is a great app. Get it;Mis;Positive;Education   
Star walk 1 is an incredibly well thought out piece of software designed to educate and provide information needed information for observing the sky. ;Mis;Positive;Education   
Unfortunately the same level of thought was not given to Star Walk 2. It appears its objective was different. Need a better app.;Usa;Positive;Education    
I love this app  Always entertaining, informative, and accurate.  Helps me get great star photos with my Cannon.;Mis;Positive;Education   
App no longer updating the calendar. What is the problem? Fix it.;Dep;Negative;Education   
Whether it is the app, the new iOS or the combination, this beautiful app hangs up constantly and crashes frequently, rendering it essentially useless. If and when it is fixed, I will go back to rating it 5 stars...;Dep,Per;Positive;Education   
This app is totally worth the money. I love it I have tried other star apps but there's no app that's as great as this;Mis;Positive;Education   
I used this app on a loaner iPad, and I pulled it out every night before I started my commute home. Working up on a hill, it was easy to see the night sky and to compare it to Star Walk's wonderinducing app. Using GPS and a teeny tiny gyroscope, it sensed my ever move of the iPad  up, down, pointing overhead  even pointing down to the ground so I could imagine what my Chilean friends would be viewing. It was therefore the first app I bought when I was gifted my very own first gen iPad, and it still works beautifully. Star Walk shows more than the stars and planets all man made satellites and the ISS are tracked and shown as well. I like having the option to view the screen in bright white on black or in night mode using a red palette.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I work in a scienceoriented community, so this is the app I pull out to convince people to get a tablet. Tis is my showstopper.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This app is so amazing, but Apple has ruined my ipad2. The app crashes multiple times before stabilizing.;Dep,Sup;Negative;Education   
Crashes upon launch in iOS 9.x. Is anyone getting the same issue? Does the app support this version?;Dep,Sup;Positive;Education   
I can change locations but it says nothing about the time zone. I should be able to change it.;Dep;Neutral;Education   
I love this app  Learn something every time I use it and have had no problems or issues with it.  It seems to be great at identifying stars, planets, constellations, satellites, space stations, etc.  the graphics and music are great  I have recommended it to many friends and have had no negative feedback at all;Mis;Positive;Education   
This has made looking at the night sky so much more fun. Works great on my iPad;Mis;Positive;Education   
ISS just passed overhead but the app says it's on the other side of the planet. Need to update the data.;Dep;Neutral;Education    
i went back to an older version of the app. i couldn't stand the visuals in the latest version. i'm so glad i did as i love this program.;Usa;Positive;Education   
I have had this app for years and always loved it;Mis;Positive;Education   
Cannot get this version to work automatically to find location.  Can only get close.  Does not recognize any change in direction, have to move manually.  Do not use any more.  On iPad 2.;Dep,Sup;Neutral;Education   
This is an awesome app. The graphics are spectacular. Need to know what the sky was like on any date You can get it here.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Want a to learn or teach your children about the constellations and orbiting technology Everything we know is up there and a quick look will answer any questions you or the kids may have.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I paid a significant amount of money for this app only to be upstaged by Sky Walk 2.  Not certain if Vito Tech will continue to provide updates to HD.  Starting to feel a bit betrayed.;Dep;Negative;Education    
We are on vacation in Mexico with friends and we used the app to look at the beautiful night sky. Amazed every time I open this app, everywhere I go from Mexico to Tahoe to Alabama. Worth every cent;Mis;Positive;Education   
Did the developers break it on purpose so we'd have to purchase Star Walk 2 Well played...;Dep;Positive;Education   
My usual trick of delete  reload doesn't work on iPhone nor iPad....HELP;Sup;Negative;Education   
This app is not showing any updates since November 2014, yet suddenly it just shuts off when starting it up. It was working fine when looking for the Lovejoy comet. What happened;Dep,Sup;Positive;Education    
Update it pains me to say Star Walk is superior to the monthsold Star Walk 2. The new app is harder to use. Too much glitz which is beautiful but gets in the way of using the app. ;Dep,Usa;Positive;Education   
So much information, so little dark sky New apps may come and go but Star Walk continues to be the best astronomy sky app. It makes me wish I lived in the country where I could get a better look at the stars.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Why does this program not work in live time What am I missing;Dep;Negative;Education   
A shame when an astronomy program gets it wrong.  In their appstore screen shots, the two people lying on the grass  the sun is shining on the right side of her head and on the left side of the moon.;Dep;Negative;Education    
This app inspires my children and I every time we use it, especially when we look in any direction and discover something new.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This app keeps thinking west is east and east is west. It looks impressive but it is wrong. You need to fix it asap.;Dep;Negative;Education   
If you have any interest in what's what in our skies, this is one must have.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is soooooo awesome Every single thing you touch it gives you information pictures and sometimes videos You can look. At planets, nebulas, and stars GET IT;Mis;Positive;Education   
I feel depressed and hope the developers don't give up the 1st version of star walk.;Mis;Negative;Education    
Not as smooth on iOS 8.  On iOS 7, I could rotate my iPad on a center axis and the 'sky' would remain impressively still, there is now a noticeable jerking as I rotate.;Per,Usa;Positive;Education   
No discount for owners of star walk 1 Screw this money grabbing company.;Mis;Negative;Education    
Really mindblowing how amazing this app is, just one tiny suggestion... I bought it to learn how to find common constellations but it is just a little too advanced for me despite science background, how about an add on interactive intro for newbieskids showing top 10  20 popular objects and facts on these to get us started.;Mis;Positive;Education   
The first time I tried this out, I had a lot of trouble.  I thought it would be more complicated than it is. But I found the embedded tutorial and found out that using this is so simple.  Now I can find anything I want in seconds. I am also stunned at how much information is easily accessible.  I use this for nighttime photography, and it is really handy;Usa;Negative;Education   
I've loved this app since the first time I saw it. It's great to be able to open this app and find answers to my questions and read about different  stars and planets. I use it to locate dates on what's happening with the real stars.;Mis;Positive;Education   
It's a real treat to look up at the sky and then find out what I'm looking at.  There's so much information you learn everyday.;Mis;Positive;Education   
It's outstanding and so helpful I don't know anything more helpful than star walk about learning the sky;Mis;Positive;Education   
One problem, the sky view does not move...it is frozen in place. How can this be fixed;Usa;Negative;Education   
Unable to tap a star to rate it, if I could, would rate the application as 4 stars.;Usa;Neutral;Education   
After trying numerous times to contact customer support with a bug report, have been unable to properly report this bug. Have seen the same write up previous to this report. Would have thought it would have been repaired by now. I still would rate the app at 4 stars, however I would rate the customer support as 1 star.;Mis;Positive;Education    
Took way too long to figure out how to set my location, which is could only approximate. In addition, it does not autosync to the sky like some of the better apps. Does not match up with the glowing reviews. Keep looking.;Per,Sup;Positive;Education   
Easy to use and pretty accurate.  Been using it for about 3 years and it's still the one I go to after trying all the other similar apps.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This app is quality.  My 8 year old is fascinated by it and enjoys it as much as I do  We learned so much together  Educational entertainment to the max;Mis;Positive;Education   
Amazing.... But I do have issues navigating after double clicking on an object in the sky, getting info and then returning to overall skyview;Usa;Neutral;Education   
This app makes star watching with the grand kids  so much more interesting.  We have a great time trying to find the different constellations and planets.  It helps them to imagine beyond our little town.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I constantly marvel at the elegance of this app. The simple, intuitive design empowers you to unfold the complexity of the universe as we know it in a fantastic graphical format. I often pick up my iPad and fire this up in the middle of the day to expose what we cannot see much less what it does to help identify what we can see at night.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I highly recommend this app. Whether you are a dreamer or a wannabe astronomer there is something for everyone at any age and stage of life.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I wasn't expecting much but got a lot less. I would like to know what I'm looking at in the sky and thought this app would help but there seems to be no connection between my iPad and the display this app provides. Sky Walk says I'm looking east when my iPad is aimed at the setting sun. It shows I'm looking at the full moon in the middle of a dark sky. Does anyone out there know how I can identify celestial objects I see in the sky This app surely isn't the answer.;Dep,Sup;Positive;Education   
Informative and useful for every age. Brings home the vastness of space for the average person. Thanks;Mis;Positive;Education   
Great app would like detailed instructions on what it can do and how to use it to its fullest potential.  Beautiful and amazing.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Beautiful app. Simple, wellorganized and runs smoothly. Good for the amateur stargazer all the way to the astronomy major.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I can sit here and get lost in this application. I absolutely love the layout and tons of information it offers. Very fun, great application.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is a wonderful app for figuring out what you are looking at.  If you see a bright star or a constellation that you are curious about this app can identify it for you.  Excellent for a leisurely night of star gazing.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Or I should say my 5 yr old grandson does. But I do too. It's so much fun and I haven't even started using the different features.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Great app to learn about the sky. I love the notifications of special sky events so that I can share them with my family and students.;Mis;Positive;Education   
The music is pretty cool too  sounds like actually being at a planetarium.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This was one of the first that I downloaded .  It is SUPERIOR;Mis;Positive;Education   
I don't use it often, so I am not as familiar as an dedicated star watcher, however, when I do use it, I think that it is tops and worth every red cent....Carlotta;Mis;Positive;Education   
If you ever looked up at the night sky and wanted to know more, get this app.  It is great. It is full of information and makes it so easy to learn about the stars and planets.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Love this app. For those of us who have trouble seeing the constellations, this app brings them to light.  Gives you all the data on stars and satellites as well. Highly recommended;Mis;Positive;Education   
This app is one of the best uses of the IOS interface available. I enjoy this App so much that I gift it to others so they can share in the wonder of exploring our celestial neighborhood. Highly recommended for all.;Mis;Positive;Education   
As an amateur astronomer, I love this app.  Perfect for the beginning astronomer;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is a fun and easy app I use to locate events in my area. Especially events we can see with our naked eyes It helps to teach kids to identify planets and stars;Mis;Positive;Education

I've had lots of issues with this app. Sky live is never accurate. Facing east and moon in sight but totally inaccurate. Waste of money.;Dep;Negative;Education   
I love to just walk outside and point this app at various parts of the sky and revel in the knowledge.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I went looking for The star Alpha Centauri and could not find it in your search. I later found it has a lesser known name. That name was there.;Usa;Neutral;Education

We purchased a telescope the other year and used it occasionally. This app has increased our usage of the telescope as we are able to easily find planets, stars, and other celestial objects. ;Mis;Positive;Education   
Very pleased with the app and the kids love it as well. They use it to search for objects in the sky and also like the included information on the object.;Mis;Positive;Education   
What an awesome app  I've been interested in astronomy my whole life and this is by far the best and least expensive app that I have purchased.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Enjoy seeing all the satellites that are in orbit.  Great for identifying the planets in the morning and evening sky,;Mis;Positive;Education   
Awesome app Just what I needed for night photography. It is very accurate when looking for the Milky Way. Totally recommended.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I love this app and show friends all the amazing things it does. I would say I am your best salesman. ;Mis;Positive;Education   
Appreciate most features, but would like to see the exact time of the full or new moon.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Begged for a review the first instant I started it. It makes no sense to me to ask for review when I have not even used the app. Deleted app. Remove the prompt.;Usa;Negative;Education    
Something about holding the known universe in your hands amd at your finger tips that impresses your parents;Mis;Positive;Education

I never thought about the galaxy that much until I found this indescribable app, love it I really suggest this app 4 not only astronomy lovers but also basically anyone.;Mis;Positive;Education

Since this app was one of the first for the iPad, it will always have a special status for me. I loved learning the definition of occultation;Mis;Positive;Education   
I enjoy this app very much. It is easy to show the grand kids what they are looking for in the night sky. The information that accompanies the screens is also interesting to my husband and me. Identifying the satellites we see passing overhead is also intriguing.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Star walk is a great app to have when you're going camping. If you're ever looking up at the stars and looking for a constellation, star walk is the app for you. No more looking at stars and not knowing their names or looking at planets and wondering what they look like up close. Star walk has all the constellations their stars and their name plus images of each planet up close. Point your device in the air to find out what star, constellation, or planet is above you. Hope u enjoy;Mis;Positive;Education   
Got this for my little girl and she loves this APP. It's super magnificent she said.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I have never given an app five stars.  This one comes close.;Mis;Neutral;Education   
This app helps when observing by naked eye, binoculars or telescope.  It almost takes the place of a spotter scope.;Mis;Positive;Education

I got this app trying to see the Big Dipper but when I held it up it didn't even show me the correct stars And it doesn't even show you constellations And it is way too much money for an app that is not going to work.;Dep;Neutral;Education

Star walk has been such a wonderful app for me. I made it a personal goal of mine to become familiar with as many constellations as I could and last night as I sat outside l was able to go 360 degrees finding one after the other.

Pure and simple this is one amazing app.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Many times the app is just confused and doesn't know what to do by changing directions randomly It is such a hype.;Usa;Negative;Education    
In a way, this app is somewhat educational, easy and fun to use Love the update even more detailed features.;Mis;Positive;Education   
That's one of the first programs, that I bought on my iPhone and I still recommend it to friends and family. This app killed specialized device, that I had and sold because of this app.;Mis;Neutral;Education   
This app is very cool, and feeds you a little info on whatever you can see in the sky.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I have had this app on my iPhone for several years. Please stop asking me to rate it.;Usa;Neutral;Education    
This is one of the first appz the I purchased, and I really think it is worth every penny.  You will love it and like myself open it many times a month and get lost in space.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This has got so much going for it, but it kept sending me alerts that I don't want. There was no info to tell me how to shut them off.  It took me forever to figure it out.;Usa;Negative;Education    
No tablet or smart phone should be without this APP.;Mis;Positive;Education   
New update is terrible. App crashes upon opening. how do I go back in time to the old version;Dep;Negative;Education   
Fix the compass. App has north, south, east and west all wrong. Makes app useless. I can't use the app because of this problem.;Dep;Negative;Education   
I had a few questions as I pressed Buy.  But once I opened and felt my way around, all my questions were answered, and many more features quickly became apparent.  It does everything, and is so accurate.  Immediately thought of gifting it to each of my kids.  Start viewing the sky, day or night, by lifting the iPad to the sky, zoom in for more detail, and watch it follow your movements and the stars move on the screen very accurately.  You can even adjust visual magnitude in settings to adapt to your present light pollution levels.;Mis;Neutral;Education   
Just goes back to the home page. I paid for this app. Fix it or I want a refund;Dep;Positive;Education   
I use this app to setup, align and explore the sky with my Celestron CPC 1100. During alignment I use it to find the name of the bright star I'm aligning too, then once I'm setup and running I use the app to find nebula and galaxies to do some very beginner astroimaging of... It helps to see what other images look like whe taking your first shots.  Would be really cool if there was a way to control the scope with this program but for now I'll just keep it as an essential for my backyard outings.;Mis;Positive;Education   
One feature I would like the author of Star Walk to implement on to a future version of this app would be the ability to capture video with the augmented reality superimposed, capturing future events and finding when and where the stars will be at a future date and time.   These videos could be used offline for power point presentations to classroom groups demonstrating a future event yet to happen...particularly in a classroom.    Just my IMHO  ;Mis;Positive;Education   
Loaded with features This is the kind of app that makes owning an iPad worthwhile.;Mis;Positive;Education   
For some reason, it said that Mercury is 1.17 AU from the sun, which means it is farther from the sun than Earth is. But it's not true;Dep;Negative;Education   
By far the best sky ap out there No hidden fees and the interface is perfect.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Only small problem is getting compass calibrated on ipad2;Sup;Negative;Education   
This is a great app. I use it often. All the info you would ever need. Very easy to use and navigate. Informative. So cool to see the planets and satellites when in view ... Enjoyable....;Mis;Positive;Education   
If you are interested in this type of stuff you will love this app. Highly recommend it.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This app is great  very convenient, simple to use and rich in its possibilities.;Mis;Positive;Education   
The night mode which well preserves the night vision  a great thing in general has one big mistake I want to believe so in catalogue it leaves the images of celestial objects completely untouched. And if we consider that these can be of colossal brightness, the fact spoils a lot of pleasure from stargazing.;Dep;Positive;Education   
I personally would like this app to have an option to turn on H.A. Rey's constellation lines, which are extremely useful because of combining advantages of maximum correspondence of constellation images to their names and of using only real stars and, hence,  the ability to find the abovementioned cool images in the sky. The starattaching lines, used on this app, have no sense for me, and that's why I use them only to differentiate one constellation from another.;Mis;Positive;Education    
This is one of my favorite apps  extremely useful, beautifully designed, user friendly, and very informative.  Great tool for when we're star gazing with our telescope.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Worth every penny to be able to point my iPad at the sky and have the constellations named in conjunction with what I see. Perfect for learners and amateur astronomers.;Mis;Positive;Education   
The visuals are nothing less than spectacular. This is a great educational program as well as a reminder of just what's 'out there' and how special we are as a thriving planet. This is also a great history lesson, too. I use this frequently when camping to learn and to just try to match what I see above me. The inclusion of all the satellites, their trajectory, and their purpose is also interesting. Absolutely nothing bad about this app Well done;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is such an easy and fun app to learn science. I love all the bits of information that I get. I love the live sky indicating our sunrise and sunset and the same from other planets. I love this and I highly recommend it....;Mis;Positive;Education   
I've got a few astronomy apps on my iPad. I'm very impressed with Star Walk the most. I've also got Starry Night Enthusiast on my PC, which I paid 79 for. This app does everything it does, it's easier to use, especially outdoors on an iPad, and it's was 110 the cost.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I use this application all the time.  When I was growing up I would see stars and constellations and just have to wonder what they were.  Now I know.  Works great;Mis;Positive;Education   
When I first this app I was totally amazed I am still enjoying opening this everyday and learning so much. All of the details are informative and beautiful photographs. Love it;Mis;Positive;Education   
You just have to work with this cool stargazing app, many photo, many details and most important, many useful information. Thank vito...;Mis;Positive;Education   
This app helps one easily see and experience the imagination of those that gazed into the night skies many, many years ago.;Mis;Positive;Education   
My family loves this app We take it on every camp out, enjoy it in our own yard, and often take it along as a late night learning activity at scout outings. The graphics are amazing and everyone from young to old can appreciate its genius.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is such a pleasure  I love walking my dog and looking at the stars it's such a big help identifying constellations and individual planetsstars;Mis;Positive;Education   
Just wish I knew which area of the sky the planets rise and set.  It gives the elevation but I don't know what that means.;Usa;Positive;Education   
This is the one to own.  Truly the best at helping me understand what I am looking at in the night sky.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is a tool that will allow me to introduce and enjoy Astronomy with my grand children.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I think I need a little faster processor and more bandwidth Excellent presentation Thanks for the gallery of images and especially the fly through videos. That's a great feature for an already excellent app.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I wish I had this app when I was a kid, I would have gotten a lot more use out of my telescope. This app has given me hours of fun and I learn new things all the time. There is something incredible about lifting my ipad up to the sky and have an incredible map of it appear live. I've noticed new features added recently that I've yet to check out fully but I would still recommend this app before even seeing new features.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This app is easy to use. Easy to find things in the sky.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Awesome app, good for kids and adults.;Mis;Positive;Education   
A lot of fun and educational at the same time;Mis;Positive;Education   
This app is fantastic. This app is what the ipad was made for.;Mis;Positive;Education   
In my opinion this is an essential iPad program.;Mis;Neutral;Education    
Opens and entire new perspective of our surrounding Universe;Mis;Neutral;Education   
This is by far the best science app ever;Mis;Positive;Education   
When I want to destress I pull this app out and either just stargaze or impress people with my knowledge of astronomy. I really can forget the time looking thru the picture of the day. A truly out of this world app;Mis;Positive;Education   
One of the most detailed and educational apps that I've used  Very complete.  Very well made.  You can spend hours getting lost in the universe in the comfort of your own home.  I love seeing where the sun is below me at night  Not only showing constellations, details about specific starsplanets, and being able to point at the sky for information, but also showing satellites in real time  All I can say is Wow;Mis;Positive;Education   
Good for people to comprehend basic information. Most stars on this app, probably I cannot get their in my entire life. But I can also get excited during this app experience. Thanks;Mis;Positive;Education   
This app is pretty cool it has a calendar when cool astronomical things are happening, it show you where things are right now. By pointing the camera at a the sun or moon it calculate where things are like satellites planets and stars. You can zoom in on planet and nebulas and galaxies and it tell you about them.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I originally got the Star Walk for my iPhone through SBux  and it has been the best app ever.  Wherever I go the universe is available for me to find or figure out  what's that in the sky.  Now that I have an iPad Star Walk was purchased for an even better window to the sky's ;Mis;Positive;Education   
Nice app for stargazers and night owls.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I am a new into astronomy and was looking for a better answer for finding my way around the vast sky. I was using paper star charts and a atlas wheel but I was never content with it or really got a complete hang of it  though I had only tried using it for a week or so. I got the idea of using an app for the job instead and started to look at what was available. Star walk HD was in my opinion going to be my best bet so I down loaded it and I could not possibly be happier. The app has everything I could have wanted and more.;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is one of the best app you can get.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Just a wonderful app. Such great visuals and so much information. Most impressive;Mis;Positive;Education   
This is still one of the best apps I've had on my iPad after all this time. I got my iPad in May 2011 and got this app shortly afterwards. My family and I ave used the app more times than its needed to be updated and still enjoy it. And yes, it is that useful to us. Enjoy it yourself or don't, but give it a shot and see what you think. So far it hasn't given me any problems and has been fairly useful.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Terrific App  A great resource.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I use Star Walk quite a bit as it helps me easily locate targets in the night sky.  Recently, I started using binoculars to view Messier objects.  Star Walk helps me to plan and then star hop to the object.   It's cool to zoom in while you are viewing the sky.  The zoom feature helps you to become very familiar with the area of the sky you are searching.  I also like to find interesting targets in Star Walk and then see if I can find them in the sky.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I use this app all the time when I star gaze at night. I love how it shows me events that are going to happen and where to look. Just a idea but could the galactic center be added. Other then that, this is a fantastic app;Mis;Positive;Education   
Gorgeous, informative, and detailed.  Make time and be fascinated again and again.  With my limited knowledge haven't found anything that needs improvement yet but there are lots of great feedback out there.  Plus, any electronic media that makes you want to look at the universe with your naked eyes is amazing, don't you think;Mis;Positive;Education   
I love this app,had the previous version but this is the best so far.;Mis;Positive;Education   
Have been using this app for years. Easy to use and full of tons of info. The AR feature is great when you are not sure of what you are looking at.;Mis;Positive;Education   
I use this app to find deep sky objects to observe with my telescope. It helps to narrow the search field but it does feel a little like cheating;Mis;Negative;Education   
As the title reads I paid for the app long ago.  Ive paid for similar but, this is the ONLY astrology app I download to all of my multiple devices.  ;Mis;Neutral;Education   
Hands down the coolest app I own. My kids love it. I love it. Everyone who sees it loves it;Mis;Positive;Education   
I have a few fairly minor complaints but I'd way rather use swype than the built in keyboard so I will deal with them. The biggest is that it's not very stable. A few times a week, it'll crash and get stuck on numbersymbol page. So I go into settings  keyboards  turn off full access then turn it back on and it'll usually solves the issue. Also, pretty pretty please add a voice to text button. Another complaint is about the emojis. Why am I stuck with the default old emojis There are so many fun new ones and I hate the yellow original ios ones. My final complaint is, I wish when I pressed and held the Swype button to change keyboards, it operated like the iOS keyboard and bitmoji and by that I mean, show a list of the other keyboards instead of next keyboard. Other than those things, Swype has improved my Apple experience immeasurably.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Utilities   
I've been using Swype for a few years now and have always loved it. Recently it seems, whenever an incorrect word weird is typed topped, the autocorrect is giving strange choices to replace the incorrect words. Most are not close except maybe the first letter, and words appearing from my swyped spellings are very strange  see words above in parentheses. Not sure what's going on but will soon be looking at other keyboard apps. It's taking a lot longer to txt than it used to I have to reread everything. When i typed the comma in second sentence above, it kept trying to capitalize the T after.  Make it great again;Dep,Usa;Positive;Utilities   
What is Swype thinking when I Swipe wss was and it gives me gibberish Wss is not a word, Swype. Get rid of the nonEngland Enjoys, Engulfs, Engulfs, English nonEnglish With a Droid, my finger could fly over the keyboard and I was astounded at the accuracy. With my iPhone, I have to slow way down and be extremely careful to go back a and correct the gibberish. If it were all English words, I could understand that. But much too often, Swype is giving my me writers words that are not in the dictionary. ;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
Often, what I get looks like it could be another language. I've checked the languages in my Stubbs settings. English is the primary language. German, French, and  are grayedout. Does that mean they are lurking in the background Because all the other dozen languages can be checked off and downloaded.;Usa;Positive;Utilities    
SWYPE you had such a great app for androids. You've completely messed it up for iPhone I'm dumping you and looking for another app.;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
I have turned off autocorrect, but this app continually changes words without reason. It's very frustrating because it also doesn't give you the option of your original word when going back to correct. Also, the entire keyboard freezes and forces you to change active keyboards in settings before it works again. This app has so much potential, but the developers seem to hate efficiency. Or maybe they just hate people, because this certainly doesn't make life easier.;Dep,Usa;Negative;Utilities   
Been using for two months. I'm not going to correct this review doo you can see for yourself some of the things it annoys me with. It usually defaults to too when you want just to. It usually defaults to off when you want off.... Of. See, just did it. Some of the more common English words or changed to the less common use. Just in the example. Of is more popular than off and to is more popular than too.;Dep;Positive;Utilities    
I had a higher rating before, and trust me, I love Swype. However, I need to put a lower rating because I am so ticked off.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Swype keeps getting stuck on the symbols page, and I have to soft restart my phone every time it happens. It happens very frequently, and I can't fix it without restarting my phone or removing Swype from my keyboards and putting in basic English as my main. I'm getting really tired of this bug, to the point where I'm going to look for a different app until this is fixed.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
Oh gee, it's only the version of the iPad that I originally downloaded this on Thanks for screwing me over, guys ONE STAR;Sup;Positive;Utilities    
Nowhere close to Android version that I've been used to on my Note 4. Many times keyboard doesn't show up, just a grey box. Emojis not easily accessible.;Usa;Negative;Utilities    
Yay Swype I missed you. It was the one thing I really missed switching from android to iphone years ago. At first I tried several apps hoping to get close but they all stunk I gave up  Fast forward years later and a couple different iPhones in between... Got anew phone and thought I'd give it a go after reading Yahweh comforts review. Thanks for that I don't need fancy, just give me Swype keyboard that works. It's like seeing an old friend. So glad I tried it again;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
LOVE that this Swype is the same if not better than the one included in the Android platform. Who has time to punch out each letter I can Swype far faster than even typing and can Swype as fast as talking in most cases. Have no idea why people don't all use it. Gives more time to life than having a face buried in a keyboard. So, yes, guess I'm a fan.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Works great and saves so much time... No more tapping away, just send it off and be done. Thank you for this app It's a must have;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Came back here to write a review and had to close the app again to be able to get the keyboard to pull up. Works about half the time. Had same keyboard with Android. Too buggy to deal with anymore;Dep;Neutral;Utilities   
When using dictation, I'll switch over to the Apple keyboard, use dictation, and then switch back to the Swype keyboard, but the keyboard will oftentimes disappear. If I don't use dictation, the keyboard works great, but otherwise, it's really buggy. No updates in 9 months with a 2 star review Not cool.;Dep,Sup;Positive;Utilities   
This app used to be glitchy and unreliable. Now, it works like magic and does exactly what it should do. Also, it has a far superior layout and features compared to similar apps like SwiftKey. Other languages are supported and work well too.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Hangs many times and many applications and I have to restart the app for it to work. Gets annoying and needs a fix;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
I love Swype it's my favorite keyboard. And I despise Swype at least once a day, my phone is useless because the keyboard won't pop up and I can't even navigate to another keyboard. No update since November Unbelievable. So many of us have this problem, and we paid for this app. I am disgusted. Another, better keyboard will come along, and I'll be thrilled to ditch you the same way you've ditched your users.;Dep,Sup;Positive;Utilities    
Especially since it's a paid app. Last update was in November. Would be nice to have the bugs addressed or even just new emojis. Good app addon. Could be better.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
The keyboard disappears randomly and makes the phone unusable for texting emails and other  text entry items. This is on IOS 10.3.3. The fixes provided by Support either don't work or are more trouble than just removing the app entirely.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
I deleted the app awhile ago because the keyboard would never pull up when I'm trying to type someone. I decided to download it again to see if that problem was fixed. It's actually worse now.... I'm not sure why I paid for this feature when I can't even use it 80 of the time. Please fix this issue;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
I can't live without Swype, but for goodness sake can it crash any more I literally reset my iPhone 6S three times a day So frustrating.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
I really don't understand why the average rating of this app is only 2 stars. I've tried them all. Gboard, Swift Key, Flexsy, Wordflow, and IGIF to name a few. None of them come close to the ease of use, accuracy, and user friendliness of Swype. If you want frills and thrills then this app is not for you. But if the thing that matters most to you is being able to Swype when you text then this app is for you. And a big plus for me is not having to switch to the number keyboard to type numbers and symbols which I absolutely hate a long press gets you there. You do have to learn where the symbols are hiding but it's worth it. Kudos Swype on being the best swipe keyboard out there;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
This used to work and I loved it.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
But it's not keeping up with the latest iOS operating systems.  My keyboard keeps disappearing, leaving only a blank, useless space.;Dep,Sup;Negative;Utilities

If I could give this once awesome app a negative rating I would. I mean really No updates or fixes for easily reproducible bugs I'm, as expected, having the exact same issues everyone else is.

Go to settings, general, keyboard, keyboards, Swype and toggle Allow Full Access. Viola It'll start working. Then go back and toggle it off again. Serious security flaw, oh right... Feature.;Dep;Positive;Utilities    
And if any developers from Swype ever read these things  Check your code for security violations This is why toggling access works. It resets whatever bad call you've made that iOS is blocking and locking up your app.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
Great When it works. Otherwise it's a POS. Seriously guys. This is my third iPhone and I've had the same issue on every iPhone. Swipe will work amazing and then you go to use Safari, click on the URL field and the keyboard is blank. There's nothing you can do about it except to delete the keyboard out of your settings. Closing out Safari and rebooting your phone does not fix the issue. Why can't they get this to effing work;Usa;Positive;Utilities   
Half the time I manually type something in that I can't swype, the app changes the word I wrote completely. I emailed someone for an appointment on the 5th, and this stupid app changed it to the 15th. Install this if you want to miscommunicate and miss important meetings.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
Your YouTube advertising says you integrate with dictation but you don't I want my money back please;Mis;Positive;Utilities    
Used to be my favorite, but lately it hasn't been stable. It often comes up blank in Messages and Safari. Their support forum seem to be mostly inactive, and their FAQ suggests upgrading to iOS 8.1 which came out in 2014. And yet Swype was updated for iOS 10 as recently as late 2016. ... Maybe they'll patch it again for iOS 11 and it will be reliable again. But I think i need to start looking for an alternative.;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
Half the time the keyboard doesn't appear and I have to restart. No updates since November 2016 Bye bye, Swype.;Dep,Sup;Negative;Utilities   
Overall a useful app, but needs critique. The autocorrect is patently bad. I want full editorial control over my posts and messages Swype's autocorrect will change words after pressing sendsubmitenter No bueno. Also it should be designed to learn my Swyping patterns and improve instead feels like it's getting worse over time, creates a lot of churn that ends up not saving time over thumb typing. But I've used worse hacks at swiping technology, so i rate it down the middle.;Usa;Negative;Utilities   
This keyboard has completely gone to crap. I can write entire sentences where it won't get a singe word correct I HATE how bad it has become;Dep;Negative;Utilities

I love this keyboard It's easy and fast and learns words quickly, it's efficient for switching between languages, which sets it apart leaps and bounds from other keyboards, but it keeps crashing on me. ;Dep;Positive;Utilities  
I hope with the next version this gets worked out. I notice problems on it somewhere between messenger, WhatsApp, and sms. Not sure if one of those interfaces or the jump between them causes the crash.;Dep,Usa;Negative;Utilities   
Among multiple irritating issues one stands out, 100 percent of the time I type im it auto corrects to in instead of i'm. Being an extremely common word, I encounter this issue constantly.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
Love that swype exists. Just not the fact that this crashes apps or just doesn't respond at all. It gives out completely different words than intended that it's almost funny.;Dep,Per;Positive;Utilities   
The initial swype technology was incredible but the bugs, inability to access the program on many phones and inability to work well on others have let it all but die. My first Android phone had Swype that worked perfectly and I enjoyed that dinosaur. Now Swype doesn't work on my iPhone 7 and it is the dinosaur.;Dep,Sup;Positive;Utilities   
Something must have happened with the newest update because it works fine until I try to use it in Facebook Messenger and then it crashes, not allowing me to even change the keyboard. The only way I can get Swype back is to shut off my phone and turn it back on again. ;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
It's also started missing some of my movements. I'm on iOS 10.3.2.;Sup;Negative;Utilities   
My first Swype experience was as a custom built in part of the Factory ROM on an Android phone. Worked flawlessly and never crashed or glitched.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Just upgraded from an iPhone 5 to iPhone 6s and now running iOS 10.3.2. Swype runs pretty well but does glitch out sometimes. The other day it completely screwed up my keyboard.

Keyboard won't open up randomly on web pages. It freezes a lot in Messenger, Facebook, and text messaging. I switch keyboards and it works fine. Also, what happened to the number keyboard like a phone or calculator I'm disappointed, to say the least. It worked great on my last two Galaxy phones, though;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
I love it and it's an awesome keyboard. Swype is one of the few things I miss from my Android phone. However, it glitches so bad at times. It won't even let me switch to the iPhone keyboard. The only thing that fixes it is restarting my phone.;Dep;Positive;Utilities  
When it works, it's outstanding. Unfortunate, more often than not, it is an epic fail. From bizarre autocorrect to malfunctions, it is consistently a bad user experience from a performance standpoint.;Dep;Negative;Utilities

The other main issue is the autocorrect feature which automatically changes words even if they're right. It gets really annoying to have to retype the same words over and over. ;Usa;Negative;Utilities   
I'm switching to Word Flow keyboard.;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
There are lots and lots of bugs in this one. No updates since almost a year ago, so don't hold your breath for them to get fixed either. It crashes a few times a week...leaving a gray space where the keyboard should be. Predictive text is rather odd... if you're used to Apple's predictive text and corrections which I find the most accurate and intuitive, you probably will be disappointed with this. The flaws are covered in more detail in the other reviews herewhich I saw beforehand and obviously ignoredso take a look before you may end up with a useless purchase.;Dep,Sup;Negative;Utilities   
Running iOS 10.3.2 on the new 10.5 iPad Pro and it is super buggy. More often than not the keyboard randomly decides to show itself or not. And when it does, the keys don't show rendering you stuck with no way to input values. ;Dep,Sup,Usa;Positive;Utilities   
Deleting it and having the stock keyboard in place, there aren't any issues with the keyboard appearing when it should.;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
I love swiping, but this keyboard changes more wordsphrasespunctuations than I can handle. You will always have to change words as you type. Great concept, but way too frustrating to continue using. If you could go into the settings and turn off autocorrect, this would be the one and only keyboard to have. Unfortunately, they don't update or fix anything. I don't generally write reviews, but I would've liked to know this before downloading the app. Good luck;Sup,Usa;Positive;Utilities    
Yes, it's still buggy but overall still saves me ton of time. Even allows me to multitask by finishing up a sentence and still look at who might start talking to might.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Used to be a 5 star app. Now it's a struggle to get it to swype even the most common words. And if it does get the correct word, it may autocorrect them to something completely different 23 words later so you aren't even aware it's been changed.  That makes for a lot of apologies for bad grammar, spelling, etc. I hope they fix this soon because I'm about done with it.;Usa;Negative;Utilities   
Program has gotten better except every once in a while it will put in a foreign language word instead of the English version. ;Usa;Positive;Utilities   
Was better and now back to bad. Hire better programmers. ;Mis;Positive;Utilities    
I have to constantly restart my programs when running Swype. This is a shame and can't believe they charge for it. They Swype blames Apple for any problems and refuses to fix their CRAP.  Can't delegate accountability people. Step up and use some of the money to fix this thing.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
Is anyone else reading the permissions it asks for when you go to install this app in your settings I was more than slightly horrified... it says this.... by installing this app you're giving the developer access and permission to transmit any and all texts that it wants to including any sensitive information that may be included addresses, phone numbers and credit card info ;Dep;Positive;Utilities    
While I would never transmit credit card info via text.... the fact that these random folks would be allowed to take anything I type and use it however they please gave me more than a slight shudder. ;Dep;Neutral;Utilities    
So for this former Galaxy user, I guess Swype will have to stay with my old phone. Bc this girl actually READS before giving you access to her phone. Change this nonsense, seriously;Dep;Negative;Utilities    
Still not fixed Does the developer not look at reviews;Dep;Neutral;Utilities    
Normally, I love this app However, lately it is constantly crashing or freezing. When it freezes, I can't even switch over to the normal keyboard. This is frustrating because I'm not able to respond to text messages over it;Dep,Usa;Positive;Utilities   
Needs an update.  The keyboard only opens half the time it needs to.;Dep,Sup;Neutral;Utilities   
I am writing this review with this and it is so fast and easy to toe with one hand especially with a popsocket I don't know why it only has two stars it is so great and it is a very smart app;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
I'm not sure what changed but this is not working like it use to.  It puts strange words in all the time. I used to be able to go fast and it would be very accurate. Not so much more.;Dep;Negative;Utilities

I was scared away by the low star score on this app and went with several other swiping keyboards following my good experience with Swype on Android until settling for the Google gboard. After getting sick of gboard's unintuitive features I decided to take the plunge on Swype again and it's like coming back home. I have no idea why it gets so few stars on the app store. It's the fastest and smartest learning keyboard out there and should be at least 4 stars average. I'm giving it five because although no keyboard apps are perfect, relative to other brands on the app store this one is a dream. For reference, I swiped this whole paragraph out in a couple minutes with no annoying problems from Swype.;Mis;Negative;Utilities   
Horrible. Android version is great. This one is terrible;Mis;Negative;Utilities    
This keyboard is unresponsive. It is not worthy anymore. Very annoying Developers this is 0.99 I wouldn't even buy this piece of crap if unresponsive.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
I love Swype and am dying having to use the iPhone keyboard but Swype will not work after the newest update. Please help;Sup;Positive;Utilities  
This app no longer works after the Apple updates. The keyboard I purchased does not appear. Words incorrect themselves three words after you type them. Previous features are no longer available, and it does not connect to the server. This is a dead app do not buy.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
Instead of trying to support all these new features like emojis, themes, etc, focus on stabilizing your main feature a functioning keyboard that uses swiping gestures. Rein it in for a bit, regroup, and focus your devs on a bevy of backlogged bugs, not features.;Usa;Positive;Utilities    
I've used Swype for many years.  On the Android system it was top notch. I could use it easily with minor complaints about auto correcting.  The iPhone version is a little painful. Anytime I enter my email address, it automatically puts a space after the  symbol.  Also, when entering numbers it doesn't stay on the number pad.  I also noticed that the emoji screen offered doesn't have all the emojis as when using the iPhone keyboard. It would be nice to be able to talk to text also without changing keyboards.  These minor changes would improve the product. That being said, I'm not willing to go back to the stock keyboard. Who really wants to use their thumbs;Usa;Positive;Utilities   
This keyboard app used to be the best ever but they have no updates and other apps have completely surpassed them .... It's a shame because I paid for this app and thought it would still be supported .... Do not buy this app it will not work correctly compared to Gboard or Swiftkey ...;Mis;Negative;Utilities    
I really love the way this app functions. I've been having a problem recently though. It had been happening on my iPhone 5s too, but since I got myself a 7s 128 gigs more often than not, I try to open the keyboard and it shows up blank and unresponsive. I finally had to uninstall the app. Let me know when you've updated and I'll gladly get back to using it. Thanks;Dep,Sup;Positive;Utilities   
The app needs to be updated to the point where I have to use the regular keyboard. Keyboard won't show just shows gray area so frustrating please fix .;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
I really like Swype. The keyboard is very smooth, but it does need to be updated. Last update was 2016. Gboard and Swiftkey update frequently. That's why I gave it 3 stars. Gboard is the best overall keyboard, but the swipe function is better on Swype.;Sup;Positive;Utilities   
It doesn't put in spaces automatically anymore. It's really annoying It also crashes on the numeric keyboard about once a day and i have to reset myphone.;Dep,Usa;Negative;Utilities   
I love the ease of the keyboard but it freezes constantly on my iPhone 7 plus.;Dep;Positive;Utilities

I have always been a pretty big fan of these types of sliding, swiping keyboards and Swype is the best available on iOS in my opinion right now.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Though, to me, the ultimate and best swiping keyboard, back from my Android phone days, was Shapewriter. There just was nothing better available anywhere, it was the absolute creme of the crop in my book.  ;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Unfortunately, Nuance Communications, the makers of this Swype keyboard, bought out the Shapewriter keyboard IPcompany back then.  And shut it down and took it off the Market. For what seems to me to be to kill off a really big competitor at the time, which was seriously unfortunate in my opinion.  And I've never found a swiping keyboard since that, that matched Shapewriter's awesome abilities and ease of use.  But, Swype, does come in at a close second I think.;Mis;Negative;Utilities    
I digress though.  I really just would appreciate it if, Nuance, would update this application soon please.  Because it's acting a little grumpy recently in some of my programs that I use it in.  Like Notability for instance.  And it's been a while since this developer has appeared to touch Swype.  ;Sup;Positive;Utilities    
I sure hope that they haven't abandoned this application.  It hasn't been long enough since the last update to conclude that in my opinion.  But the time since the last update has me a bit concerned.;Sup;Positive;Utilities    
So, thanks to Nuance for this great app and please update the program soon to make it fully compatible with other applications and especially with the latest iOS build, please.  And as I said, I just do not believe that you can find a better slidingswiping keyboard on iOS.  Thanks for bringing this superb tool to Apple and God bless.;Sup;Positive;Utilities   
Would you also please bring out some fun and stylish new keyboard themes for Swype as well.  I think that it would be great to have some themes that had an effect that made each key light up when pressed or swiped.  I would be grateful and appreciate it if you would consider adding new themes please, and thank you if you do so.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Constant crashes Crazy making on iPad. So Frustrating. When will you fix it? ;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
And please write what I type before predicting...;Mis;Positive;Utilities    
I love it ... what a time saver I'm completely spoiled by the swype keyboard function. I was texting with a friend who couldn't spell any better than a 1st grader, then told him to download it, now he types fast and near perfectly. Finally I'm focusing on his content rather than his flaws. I'm currently downloading it to my kids' phones as per their requests. The reviews have brought my attention to a glitch I've been experiencing which is my keyboard sometimes will not open. I just close out and sleep via power button then usually in 3 seconds it will open back up. Swype bug Maybe. Not a big deal to me. Swype increases my phone fondness two fold... seriously. It's like my phone has ESP. It works everywhere like in what's app , imo, and microsoft word. When it's turned off I feel like my phone is broken or naked... I can't live without it ;Mis;Positive;Utilities    
I love this app but it needs an update bad. My keyboard locks into numeric and will not get out of it. I have to go to settings and turn off app and sometimes reboot my phone before it will let me type. Please update.;Sup;Negative;Utilities  
I desperately want to use this app, but the keyboard freezes up about 50 of the time I try to use it. Sometimes the only way to fix it is to completely shut off the phone. It's just not worth the hassle anymore.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
I've used Swype for years and I love it but currently every word I write is wrong.;Usa;Negative;Utilities

This is the only thing I missed from my android. I'm so happy it works on my Apple products now;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
It usually works great. But lately it has been crashing constantly. You need to fix it.;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
Functionality is fine and works better than the iPhone keyboard but the correction is absolutely retarded. Replaced what with weekday, wiring with worrying, algorithm with southern, just completely inappropriate words in sentences. Many times it's right until you hit space or add another word. Most irritating ALWAYS replaces or for four and our If the correction wasn't replaced with want designed by a four year old which it just replaced with yippe. It would be a five star app;Dep,Usa;Negative;Utilities   
When I switched from android to iOS I missed this option and was happy to see I could get it. I was even willing to purchase it with the thought that it would be as reliable as on Android. Unfortunately it has gotten worse as time goes on. It seems more and more often, the keyboard crashes on me and I have to kill the app I'm using numerous times before the keyboard will work again. Please fix this To users considering purchasing this, I would recommend not spending the money until they do an update fixing the current bugs.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
When I call up a search and the keyboard should be popping up, a large blank gray space arrives instead. I can neither request a different keyboard nor view the keys of my Swype keyboard in this gray space. THERE ARE NO KEYS;Usa;Negative;Utilities   
This has been going on for months. In order to write this review, I went to Instagram which for some odd reason is the only app I have which gives me the option of which keyboard I want to use. In every other application the Swype keyboard is now a large gray space from which there is no escape. ;Usa;Negative;Utilities   
I have used Swype on my Android phone for many years now and have never, ever had problems.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Once again don't expect great from an app you've paid for... I'm on iOS 9 so I figured I'd try this again. No update since June so I don't have high expectations.;Sup;Negative;Utilities    
The keyboard frozen all the time and it crashes sometimes. Please fix the problem.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
The app is kind of buggy, so I won't repeat what other reviewers have already said. My only complaint is that I have to go back to the regular keyboard to use an emoji that is my complexion as I can't change the shade of emojis using the Swype keyboard. Come on guys.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
This thing works sometimes but it's so freaking frustrating when it fails to load. It gets stuck on the numbers screen or the keyboard just plain doesn't show up. Also, it doesn't keep deleted words deleted. It seriously needs an update but it hasn't gotten one in like years.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
Edit  HELLO Is anybody at Swype paying any attention Read these comments. We are all complaining about the same thing and from day one. I am downgrading to 4 stars. More times than not, Swype will pull up a blank keyboard that will allow no input whatsoever, I can't even change back to generic Apple keyboard when this happens. I have to power down to fix it. But it just happens again a few hours later. I can't use it anymore. It has to be fixed. AUTOCORRECT is still terrible. Still changes common words like this to an obscure word like rusty or have to gaffe, etc. STOP IT Other swiping apps are getting better. The gap is closing. You are going to lose customers if you don't remedy these issues.  ;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
Swype is a great app and I give it 5 stars. If you disagree, try some of the other swiping apps. That said, why is it you cannot fix the issues that have plagued the app since day one Autocorrect cannot be turned off. The toggle onoff button is useless. This is how it has always been. Of course, nobody wants it permanently off, but I'd rather that than deal with Autocorrect's habit of changing common words to the most obscure word possible. When I type awesome, why are you changing it to sardine How often do you think the word sardine is used by your average English speaker You can't fix this And finally the personal dictionary. Why have an option of manually adding words to my personal dictionary when you will add them on your own You add email addresses and other useless words to the dictionary with no input from me. These issues have been prevalent for years.;Mis;Neutral;Utilities   
This is the best keyboard with Swype on the market in my opinion. That is, when it's working. If they can get this thing working properly and consistently, I would give it 5 stars easily. I love the accuracy and the layout of the keyboard. I really like how you can long press letters and they turn into the corresponding number. The other reason I gave this 2 stars is another major problem. I purchased a theme black keyboard on two separate occasions and both times I had to delete and redownload the app to hopefully get it working properly after it was acting extremely buggy. Please reimburse or give me my keyboard back.;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
1 yar later and it is still garbage Still no updates which renders the app difficult to use AND there are shortcuts that obviously are not created by myself.;Sup;Negative;Utilities    
Note to the developers, try using a normal dictionary instead of a custom one our trending or even make it do that the end user can download the additional dictionaries.;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
It doesn't load most times when I'm trying to use it. Getting my money back...;Dep;Neutral;Utilities   
I used to love this app but recently it's been acting up after I upgraded to the latest version. It would get stuck in the symbols keyboard when using Messages and wouldn't let me click anything. I can't change to another keyboard either and locks it up until restarting the phone. Please fix.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Utilities

I hate hate hate trying to tap tap tap or more than a few words on a touchscreen keyboard. The Swype input style is so much faster and more comfortable for me. I was so glad when Apple finally allowed 3rd party keyboards because I really wanted to be able to use this method, having used it on my Android tablet already.;Mis;Negative;Utilities   
So I'm happy with having that ability.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
I'm not at all happy that a few times a week it freezes up, locking on the numericpunctuation keyboard, and forcing me to remove the keyboard before I can continue using the phone, and forcing me to reboot the phone to be able to use it again.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
There are other faults, but this one is genuinely frustrating. Needs to be fixed.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
Unfortunately, for the last few months the swipe keyboard hasn't opened up reliably in numerous programs. It's stalls the programs, and sometimes it comes back when the phone is rebooted. Right now I have it turned off, because I need to be able to work on my phone, and I can't with swype crashing every few minutes.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
With each iPhone update this program works less effectively. My phone freezes constantly and the only fix is a reboot.;Dep,Sup;Positive;Utilities   
This keyboard for some reason within the IOS environment is complete crap. Skips, freezes, provided words that aren't even close to what was intended...did I say it was crap Also this uses vast amounts of system resources and cause my iPhone 7 plus to over heat.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
Very intuitive. I don't get the bad reviews. Likely user errors. Last night my 75 year old Mother  85 year old stepfather were learning it and picked it right up. My 9 year can use it as well. High recommend.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
But it was not good. Autocorrect after punctuation is completely out of control. I can type something, maybe, with the word year and then punctuate it, and it changed it to yearold. It does that a lot, hyphenating words when punctuating sentences.;Usa;Negative;Utilities   
My latest and greatest issue is that the keyboard doesn't appear at all, when I go to type something in. It doesn't matter what app I'm using at the time. Could be a problem with the iPhone, but started after the last update for this app.;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
I have always loved and used this app. Please fix it.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
On iPhone 6 ios, keyboard would fail to pop up frequently. Very unreliable. Does not remember frequent corrections e.g. My U will always get autocorrected to I. Hilarity ensues.App removed.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
It refuses to open consistently in whatsapp and in other scenarios at all. Forcing me to restart my phone just to get the default keyboard back and disabling Swype. If I could get a refund I would. I never had a problem on my android phones with Swype, I'm unsure why the iOS version is so bad;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
The app is great when it actually works but the last update was November 2016 and its May 2017. I love this app but I hate how it crashes more often than not.;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
Lots of bugs that cause you to quit apps midtyping, and no updates to the software in years of using it. Trying something new now, not worth the effort.;Dep,Sup;Negative;Utilities

I love using Swype. Originally started on android, then moved to iPhone. This was the first app I purchased. Recently, I've noticed my swipes haven't been giving the correct words. I haven't changed how I swipe. Very frustrating especially because it use to work so well;Usa;Positive;Utilities   
I had to have this when I switched from Android to iOS a couple of years ago. It worked well at first, but is increasingly buggy and I have to reset my phone regularly. After a blank keyboard has continuously popped up for two days, I finally deleted it tonight. Super annoying;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
Wack. This keyboard freezes up, mistypes random words, doesn't type words, etc. etc. It just froze up on me and I was unable to type any word using it today.;Dep;Neutral;Utilities   
Further, random words that make no sense come up when I try to type. Type equaling retire Serioymu equaling seriously Pathetic.;Usa;Negative;Utilities

It is regularly inaccurate, it autocorrects, and auto spaces inconsistently. It's very buggy. It used to be a joy to type with like four years ago, but it has been a slow decline.

Here's the review I just wrote on one I tried I had been using Swype for several years. Since my first iPhone after leaving the droid platform. ;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
Little did I know. I reswiped the word more than three times and it wasn't even an option in the suggestion list. ;Usa;Neutral;Utilities

I tried a little longer to let it learn me but I quickly dropped it and went running back to Swype ;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
When you back space to delete the wrong word in Swype, it removes the entire word it just chose. In this app, it chose a whole word just the wrong one but you have to delete each letter Ugh ;Usa;Negative;Utilities   
The predictions were terrible and totally non intuitive. ;Usa;Negative;Utilities    
Maybe there are good features, but if it can get the basics right, I'll never know about bonus features. ;Usa;Negative;Utilities

I gave it four stars because I get frustrated when I check that it chose the right word, but after I hit sendpostetc, I see it changed a word. ;Usa;Negative;Utilities    
However I love the smart predictions, lots of shortcuts, full word edits, and that they continue to make improvements. ;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Swype used to be a good keyboard, till every word you swiped got changed to a word that is irrelevant to your conversation causing you to have to put more time into the message. Until the bugs are fixed I won't use Swype.;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
I was a swype user back when I was on Android, and I was happy to see my favorite third party input solution coming to iOS, however, they don't seem to care for updating on IOS platform nearly as much as they do on Android or have they stopped updating there as well . It often stucks at a blank screen, problems like such have not been solved throughout their super slow and very few updates. And I wonder why they support so many languages already on Android, but way less on IOS. No matter how users express their need, they just don't seem to care.;Dep,Per,Usa;Positive;Utilities   
Rumor has it that the next iOS system update will no longer support 32 bits apps, if they don't update, it's not accessible for its users anymore.;Sup;Positive;Utilities    
Ppl at Swype, you do remember that we paid for this app, right;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
One major complaint of mine is who the heck was responsible for the word prediction algorithm It's incredibly atrocious, please fix this or at least have it better predict words and stop auto correcting words that are correct just because the algorithm thinks another word fits better when in reality it doesn't.;Usa;Positive;Utilities    
I have to shut off the option because it stops working so frequently. I will either get a blank panel with no input or NOTHING. Same with my iPad. Pretty disappointed.;Sup;Negative;Utilities   
I get that this app is more focused for you to swipe with but I bought it because of the old customizations and the themes were free And oddly enough, it seems that this app has gotten significantly worse over the times. Now it just seems that SwiftKey is better in every possible way.;Mis;Positive;Utilities    
Needs more frequent updates. Bugs have persisted for too long. Need to fix them fast. ;Sup;Neutral;Utilities    
The keyboard itself is unstable won't open reliably, most notably in Gmail and Messages. ;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
I love the shortcut gestures, but some still are either buggy or aren't intelligent enough yet. Often a comma erases the letter before it and replaces it with a space also, typing emoticons is a bit of a hassle because it autocorrects the space and pushes the colon back up against the text there are similar but opposite problems with quotes and parentheses, where a space will be added where none is needed. ;Dep,Usa;Negative;Utilities   
Autocorrect needs to be more obvious when it replaces a phrase. I will look at the word I just typed, see that is correct, and move on, only to sometimes catch later that an entire phrase has been replaced incorrectly. Makes for an aggravating experience. I like what they are trying to do, but the intelligence isn't there yet. Phrase replacement ought to be an option than can be turned off. ;Usa;Positive;Utilities    
I've tried all the other swiping keyboards and always come back to this one because of the punctuation gesture shortcuts and how easy it is on the dark keyboard to long press for other punctuation marks. Also, I text shortcuts in iOS and would like to see Swype better incorporate those as well. ;Mis;Positive;Utilities

I've had Swype since it was an Android only option. After I switched to iPhone platform, I waited anxiously for Swype to release a compatible app. I've used it since, but finally had to quit and try other options. Swype crashes constantly, requiring rebooting of the phone or reloading of the app. It's infuriating. But the details on this keyboard make it awesome. Fix your bugs, and I'll come running back.;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
This keyboard I believe is probably the only keyboard on iOS which I haven't ever received a strange crash with even back when the code was buggy in iOS 8. With that being said, development cycle for this application is incredibly slow. Would be cool if they would actually fix some of the glaring issues with the keyboard. Those being related to the main reason you would use this keyboard, the swipe function is incredibly buggy. If the user does it too quickly, remnants of the slide trail before remain on the keyboard. Also the resolution of the trails is terrible and has been since keyboard launch in iOS 8. There's also random letters which the key press popup is delayed. Specially the letter Q, the last one not a huge issue but annoyingly lazy it still happens over two years later. If these couple of issues were fixed, this would 100 be best iPhone keyboard.;Dep,Sup,Usa;Positive;Utilities   
I can't Swype and drive at the same time. Add a voice dictate feature like apples keyboard;Mis;Positive;Utilities    
I really missed Swype when I switched to my iPhone from my Galaxy S6 so I looked it up here and installed it. It's working alright. A big drawback is no emoji's and no capability to use voice to text in this keyboard. I have to switch between keyboards to use voice to textemoji's. In my opinion, that's kind of a fail on the part of the Nuance Communications.;Usa;Negative;Utilities    
I used to love Swype but now I really add heating out. That was supposed to be am hating it. I am now reduced to typing letter by letter. How in the world does swyping am result in add Makes no sense. Now when I try to Swype the word off I invariably get pig. Please fix this.;Usa;Negative;Utilities   
Love the app, but can we get new design. Not with just flat options but some raised letters some new fun colors themes. Would be amazing if you could make the user interface better.;Usa;Positive;Utilities   
I LOVE Swype on android. However, there are a ton of issues with iPhone. This includes autocorrect with numbers, which is frustrating. What is most inconvenient is the freezing. The keyboard will freeze and I can't even switch to the regular keyboard to continue typing. Once frozen, the keyboard will not work on any app including text message and safari. The phone needs to be restarted for the keyboard to work again. This happens at least once per day and probably 12.5ft that was supposed to be 1.5 but it autocorrected times per day. Please fix these issues and put out an update;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
I hate this keyboard, it's really annoying.;Mis;Negative;Utilities    
Very impressed with improvements. The old versions you would have to switch to the Swype keyboard before every use. Now that that's fixed its really nice now.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
I had a Swype keyboard on my last LG phone and I truly can never go back. I always had a hard time punching out words with the tiny tiles and then this happened and I can respond as fast as or faster than I can receive. It's truly the most wonderful keyboard and I can't imagine typing on a mobile device without it. By now, so many are used to thumb typing but, I encourage those tappers to try swyping for a week or so you only need one hand. It's a beautiful thing;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
I bought this despite the bad reviews because it was my favorite Android keyboard. Figured the problems couldn't be nearly as bad as the reviews made it out to be. Huge mistake, this keyboard is AWFUL.;Mis;Negative;Utilities    
After this sentence, I'll stop making corrections and instead put the correct words in parentheses to show how bad the predictions are.;Mis;Negative;Utilities    
Weird words tired typed mostly on one line give this keyboard fits. The avoid android version eventually learns and gets better. This doesn't. It also rarely had has the right word in the list of choices, so you have to toe type it manually, or make really exaggerated stored swipes so it figures it out. It also likes to change stuff after Macias manual typing, wasting tins tons of time.;Mis;Negative;Utilities    
Typing numbers is another major problem. You can't long press keys to get digits like android, and the keyboard goes back to Keyes letters after one number. Do so it takes two keepers keypresses per number.;Usa;Positive;Utilities    
There's also dine some weird bus bugs like inserting 'b' or 'q' keeps keypresses at the start of typing, and freezing up. Thought I was accidentally doing it, but I just watched as I pressed the 'c' button and it inserted 'bc'.;Usa;Negative;Utilities    
This is a poor imitation of the Android version. Don't be fooled like I wss was, Dave save your money avg and skip this trash.;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
It's learning algorithm needs serious work. I've had to manually type half of this because it's given me words that aren't even close.;Usa;Negative;Utilities

Unfriendly user , useless features, overall waste of money, time , and even storage space on my sixty gigabit phone;Usa;Negative;Utilities    
I loved my Windows Phone, but as a prepaid user, options were nil... even for a Windows Phone user. Nice being current and relevant when it comes to apps after switching to iPhone, but the default keyboard is awful. Swype makes typing a dream. I can spit out message faster and more accurate with Swype, and without that nasty as carpal tunnel to boot. Well worth the price. Really don't understand the negative review here. Swype is perfect.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Even with all autocorrect off and the Apple dictionary disabled, Swype still generates nonsensical words.  That, it freezes on the numeric keyboard input, requiring a hard rest of my iPhone 6 to correct.;Dep,Sup;Negative;Utilities   
I'm looking for a different app.;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
The actual input of swype odd great, but the increase in unresolved bugs and small irritating nuances have become too annoying to keep using. I will delete the app after this review but I'm hoping for improvements down the road.;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
Biggest issue is the keyboard crashes and doesn't appear frequently safari, messaging, other apps. Usually takes 30 seconds of random touchesclosing and reopening of apps before it comes back. And there is no way to switch keyboards when this happens. This started last year and hadn't gotten any better.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
Second most annoying is the keyboard switch. I use other keyboards with unique capabilities but switching between is annoying because only the swype keyboard requires a long press. And it's in a different location that every other keyboard including the default Apple keyboard. And it launches a menu instead of just switching keyboards. ;Usa;Negative;Utilities    
Swiping has always been great. Even really approximaterough swipes will typically surprise me and get the write word or give me the right word in the list of three closest guesses. ;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Autocorrect is getting better. Updates have allowed easier learningentering of unique phrases.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Love swipe but A constant issue with iphone 6 is my keyboard reverts back to the stock key board every time I send a new text. They fix it but every time a new iOS comes out, it happens again. Don't get me wrong it's the only key board I use. Just wish they would fix it faster when there is an iOS update..... Update apr 2017, please update for iPhone 7 program is misspelling words constantly.;Dep,Sup;Positive;Utilities   
FiX this bug it's ridiculous. It happens a lot on safari and chrome. It happens sometimes on the messages app too. IPhone 7 plus Verizon.;Sup;Negative;Utilities   
I really like this app... the only problem is... that on Safari and Google app... it shows a blank area where the keyboard should be... why.. the other browser apps .. Bing... Opera Mini... DuckDuckGo... Dolphin Pro... Puffin... and Yandex, it works fine.. no issues.. When are you going to fix this ..  I hope that you do... sorry I can only give you 2 stars...;Usa;Positive;Utilities    
I've always loved Swype. But, I have similar complaints as some of the other reviews.;Mis;Positive;Utilities    
I have autocorrect off. Just auto spacing. So when I add punctuation after pressing the 123 key, I expect the word to stay the same. Not be autocorrected to a completely different word. It's very frustrating. I usually have to hit space and then add the punctuation. It'll usually correct itself and addon the punctuation to that sentence then. Just inconvenient tho. ;Usa;Negative;Utilities    
It also freezes A LOT. I'll be texting and it freezes. Or typing in something on safari. It freezes to the point where I actually need to shutdown my iphone. It just won't let me type. My phone doesn't freeze, the Swype keyboard freezes. So it's obviously the app. ;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
I've contemplated just using the regular keyboard now. It's more time consuming using Swype.;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
Read on, new or potential users, this review isn't all bad news and complaints;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
This would be a 5 star review if I didn't need to reinstall the keyboard just to finish typing an email or text message, or use text input literally anywhere, after switching apps or clicking outside of the input box or some other unknown arbitrary action that Swype decides it just can't handle. ;Dep;Neutral;Utilities   
I actually came to the App Store just now not to write this review but to find a replacement for Swype.;Mis;Neutral;Utilities    
I've been using Swype across all of my devices since it's earlier days, I constantly recommend it to anyone I know with an iPhone, and overall absolutely love the ease of use and functionality. Swype offers all the options I want out of a keyboard and more that I hadn't even considered. It has a beautiful and simple UI, and this definitely deserves a huge hat tip to the designers for integrating functionality with the workflow in a stylish way.;Mis;Positive;Utilities   
Over past several months the keyboard will simply disappear when I try to type within any application. A large grey box appears where the keyboard should be but.. no keyboard. ;Dep,Usa;Negative;Utilities   
Ok, just a bit annoying but easy to work around by clicking somewhere else on the app and then back on the text box, and the keyboard pops up normally. We're back in business. ;Usa;Positive;Utilities   
Except for the other times this bug makes my iPhone unusable for typing...which is.. well, the only function a keyboard NEEDS. Once that empty grey box appears I cannot use any keyboard in any app across my entire phone. The only work around I've found is going into the iPhone settings, removing the Swype keyboard and then readding it. Specifically Settings  General  Keyboards  Keyboards  Remove Swype  Add Swype;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
I really do love this app when it works. I've tried almost every other swipe style keyboard I can find and none of them compare to Swype as I explained earlier... but this bug is beyond being a mild annoyance now and is making me look for another keyboard at this very moment.;Mis;Negative;Utilities    
I've tried the most popular keyboard, each for a week. G board was probably my favorite under this one. But the predictions weren't as good as swype. ;Mis;Positive;Utilities    
I do wish that this app would inherit the same features as the Android version like word selection, all select, copy and paste etc.;Mis;Positive;Utilities    
Typing with the regular keyboard is long and monotonous and starts hurting my fingers. I love Swype. But right now writing this review, I am not able to use it. Why Because there is a glitch that sometimes happens quite often once a week where the keyboard gets stuck on the symbols page and doesn't allow me to switch back to the alphabet keyboard. I have to switch back to my normal keyboard for a few hours before it starts working again. If this glitch gets fixed, it's definitely a 5 star app I'll be waiting to change my review Swype Please fix;Dep;Positive;Utilities   
Keyboard gets stuck on certain apps like snapchat and imessage and cannot type. There is no way to restart the keyboard to fix the glitch. Worst part is when it freezes you can't switch keyboard so you have to disable it to use the Apple keyboard.;Dep;Negative;Utilities   
For some reason, it worked for three months, but now constantly freezes and just shows the numberpunctuation keyboard. Froze again when I started this review;Per,Usa;Neutral;Utilities   
Literally unusable in iOS 11. I am uninstalling this sad dated POS;Usa;Negative;Utilities   
Swipe frequently disappears, forcing me to switch to another app, bring up a stable keyboard, and switch back. Pretty pathetic for the premier swiping keyboard. When it works it works.;Dep,Usa;Negative;Utilities   
Literally crashes a few times a day. Only way to fix is to restart my phone. Fix please;Dep,Usa;Positive;Utilities   
This is an absolutely AWFUL addition to your app. I paid for this keyboard. Im now uninstalling it, there are SO MANY bugs. The words change when you hit send, the stupid emojiis are distracting and not at all welcome. I used to love Swype and promoted it to my friends in spite of the issues but not anymore.;Dep,Sup,Usa;Negative;Utilities   
I've commented before there's no functional purpose requiring location services be on always or never.  This binary option is for the collection of data plain and simple.  Now popup's  Really  I got an obtrusive message about a SeaTow service which isn't available in my area by the way on screen while I was navigating.  Now I see the true purpose of Navionics alwayson location tracking.  Selling adverts.;Usa;Positive;Navigation    
I thought smarter app developers were beyond this kind of nonsense.  It's simple if you need the money offer a small fee to users to AVOID this type of disturbance.  Especially while navigating  This is a pretty good app and I use Navionics software on my Raymarine systems.  But the developers are going to ruin it and lose customers with this nonsense.;Mis;Negative;Navigation   
Love the app but please make it easier to add waypoints. And quit calling them markers, they should be called waypoints.;Usa;Positive;Navigation

When the orientation switches to landscape the details speed, heading, etc disappear. Please fix this.;Usa;Positive;Navigation   
I have fished out of a kayak for a long time and have a basic depth finder. This app replaces the need to upgrade to a more expensive unit as it replaces the lake mapping.;Mis;Neutral;Navigation   
If you're simply fishing specific structure lines and specific depths, especially while trolling, this can replace a depth finder completely ;Mis;Neutral;Navigation   
Download doesn't work even while on wifi. Basically useless;Sup;Negative;Navigation   
Frustrating to have to wait fir the map to draw when you pan the screen. Each screen can take 1015 seconds to appear. I like the concept and the map download so you don't need to be online to use it but man is it slow;Per;Negative;Navigation    
Asks to agree to terms EVERY time you open the app. This should only be asked during the first screen load. ;Usa;Positive;Navigation

We bought a new boat in Maryland and had to drive it home to the north shore of Long Island through waters we were completely unfamiliar with. The equipment on the boat was not functioning as hoped and this app came to the rescue. Our trip was plotted for us easily and the we found fuel docks with the app and navigated home easily and safely with no problems. Thank you Navionocs;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Great app, but doesn't have the option to only use my location when I'm using the app, so it kills my battery. Please fix this feature.;Mis;Negative;Navigation   
Got this app to help me isolate points and depth for ice fishing. I live in Colorado and our lakes are small granted, but to advertise as an accurate topographical map is an insult. I have verified by boat and depth finder the inaccuracies of the app for one lake I love to fish. This may be a better application where larger bodies of water are found, but not for Colorado. I rue the purchase.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
What you see today might not be what you see tomorrow.  I used this app that I purchased to fish flats with the satellite overlay.  Now they have made satellite a subscription service.  What will they take away next;Mis;Neutral;Navigation    
Purchased this app after purchasing the previous version because Navionics felt it was good treatment of their customers to make them buy the same app again instead of upgrading the original version. Then after buying this version which came equipped with satellite images, they have now taken that away and require the annual subscription to Navionics plus. ;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
This company treats its customers almost as bad as United Airlines.;Mis;Negative;Navigation    
I found the app to be ideal for USA Lakes Super helpful for navigating new waters and knowing the typography of the lake you are fishing. For a 10 app I found it to be feature rich and very user friendly.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
You buy the app, then buy the maps, and every update they take more and more features away and make them all subscription based only. Biggest waste of money in the entire App Store. ;Mis;Negative;Navigation    
This app is horribly inaccurate, it tells me depths that are no where near the actual depths of the areas, on almost every lake I've ever looked at it on, save your money, this app is trash;Dep;Negative;Navigation

I have saved all my fishing spots and potential spots when it hit 200 spots it stop allowing me to save anymore.  You can not buy anymore waypoints so now I have to start deleting spots which I hate doing. ;Mis;Neutral;Navigation   
I am hoping they fix this as soon as possible.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
If they don't I will have no choice but to start using another navigation app which allows more waypoints.;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
I have been told by Navionics that Andriod does not have such a small limit why can't they get this fixed on IOS10;Sup;Neutral;Navigation    
This is a paid for app. We should not need to have to see adds in the app. ;Mis;Neutral;Navigation    
Also, make the app so you can use the location service be turned on only when the app is used. Other apps that have location can use this feature, this one should as well.;Usa;Positive;Navigation    
Not liking the ads for more garbage. Especially while navigating my boat. Isn't my subscription enough to remove them;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
I don't like how I have to force the GPS to shut off so it doesn't eat my battery.;Usa;Negative;Navigation    
Really great App when it works while boating I bought it a second time because it would not update stopped working suddenly  I feel ripped off ;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
Now works but still will not update even though   I have over 300 days left to my paid subscription;Sup;Neutral;Navigation   
I can download the app anymore,it's a Grey logo and always says installing.;Sup;Positive;Navigation   
The app worked okay until I went to renew my subscription.  I was charged 4.99 for the renewal through iTunes, but never got the renewal.  I played emailphone tag with the company, Navionics, but every time I called them it was at least a two hour wait time on hold ...TWO HOURS ON HOLD  Then, Navionics blamed iTunes and iTunes blamed Navionics for me not getting the renewal I paid 4.99 for.  Neither Navionics nor iTunes will correct this problem because they're both blaming the other for the problem.  Meanwhile, I got burned out of 4.99 FOR NOTHING.  To add insult to injury, I've paid for other in app purchases through this same app, but if I can't renew the subscription they're WORTHLESS.  At least 30.00 wasted and Navionics nor iTunes cares one bit about it.;Mis;Negative;Navigation    
What the heck happened to being able to select date range for wind predictions  Also, now I'm constantly nagged about renewing a subscription from the weather info screen with no way to turn it off.;Usa;Negative;Navigation    
I have rated this app 5 stars in the past, and for coastal navigation I would still give it at least a 4 rating.   ;Mis;Neutral;Navigation   
The BIG failure now is the the app does not navigate offshore no gps location whereas other apps like Garmin Bluecharts do work.   This is a big problem with Navionics.;Usa;Negative;Navigation    
This app is amazing for any lake, bay, or ocean. I uploaded the local lake maps of the area and already have the fishing spots ready to go with lures to match the depth of the water. This app is revolutionary and for 9.99 this will be the best tool in your tackle box.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Best 10 bucks I've ever spent on the boat. So helpful, can't describe. Replaced thousands of dollars in paper charts.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Guys, stop whining, it's a 10 app that gives you everything about the body of water your on. Or use it for planning a trip, I use it on the couch all the time.  Great app;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
How do you get lakes added I bought this to use at my local lake and it's not on there. PLEASE ADD BLUE MOUNTAIN LAKE IN ARKANSAS I can see how it is very useful.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Definitely worth the 10 Just a heads up tho it drains your battery very fast, bring a charger. 5 renewal after a year, it will always be a part of my fishing arsenal;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I highly recommend finding another app. Navionics has the worst customer service. ;Mis;Negative;Navigation    
I purchased this app thinking like most apps you can also use the IPad version of it. NO To use the iPad HD version you have to purchase it again. That is absurd, how many apps do we have on our iPhone that the HD iPad version is also free to use These greedy people want to charge you twice. Did I mention customer service confirmed the HD version has the EXACT same features as the iPhone version that I already paid for ;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
I have used the app locally Chesapeake  Bay and along the east coast. It is very user friendly and the Auto feature between way points is the portion I use the most.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Not worth the trouble. Save your money. Sad that they want to charge for this crap.;Mis;Negative;Navigation    
I've had this app for yrs now. Now u want me to pay for it again Oh and for every year after that like a yearly subscription to keep using ur app. Sorry, Not anymore;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
I am very impressed with the quality of the maps  depths and markings are spoton and even seem a little more accurate than the printed lake maps I have. For only 10 I was wondering how this would work since they sell their USA lake map chip for 200... When you start the app or at any time you select the area you want to download  I'd imagine there is a limit. I downloaded several of my surrounding counties which got me all of the corresponding lake maps in excellent detail. ;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I use this ice fishing in place of a 200  300 GPS and it works perfect. I can see exactly where I am and the depth  structure and the Vexilar confirms what the map is showing. ;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I somewhat agree with one other review about the limit on waypoints, however, with my iPhone, when I want to mark a spot I just switch to the maps app and mark it there  which I can always use again to get right back to that spot  easy workaround.;Usa;Positive;Navigation    
Why limit waypointsYour STILL limiting waypoints... WHY;Usa;Neutral;Navigation    
The new updated made the app really glitchy if I try and use the navionics portion of the depth finder it won't even read the whole lake it just stops and cuts everything off. So in most of the lakes you want to fish you have to use the sonar feature but that only works best if you buy something else as well and even then not all the lakes look great and like they're supposed too.;Dep;Positive;Navigation   
this is not worth downloading if it was free.    there are several others available that are free or lower priced that give you must more detail and information on lakes and waterways.    i am really sorry i downloaded this, i hope to review will aid others in not making the same mistake.;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
The lake maps don't have depths or contours on them.   There is cheaper or even free apps available that are a lot more detailed.   This is the first review I have ever written but this needed said.;Usa;Positive;Navigation    
Great app. I've been relying on it for years. Recently I notice when using the wind forecast, when I touch the wind speed symbol wind barb the actual wind speed does not appear. In past versions of the app the wind speed would appear after a tap. Please fix this.;Usa;Positive;Navigation  
Gave it sea trials tonight. When I exited the program it popped up a screen asking about running in background. Neither option worked  Continue or Setting. It did hang the phone. Had to sync with my laptop and remove it. Reinstalled it and same screen again. Removed it again and won't reinstall. High risk application.;Usa;Positive;Navigation   
You can't beat this app for detail I use it in conjunction with my full size plotter and as a backup. Great app  Worth every cent;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Although the iPhone app may not be accuratesafe enough for realtime navigation, the disclaimer makes that clear, and the details and technology of the app are excellent for information and planning. The technology and route planning is more sophisticated than many chart plotters, for a fraction of the price. I am a big fan;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I use this app in the Pacific Northwest, including the Columbia  Willamette rivers and so far I'm very impressed. I don't really have much to compare it to, but the charts are very detailed and so far extremely accurate. ;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
The plotter page is wonderfully intuitive with easy taptoplace waypoints and very professional speed, BRG, dist next windows. You can input your boat's specs to anticipate leglength and fuel consumption. ;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
It even has a massive search database for locating fuel and any written info on sections of your voyage. ;Mis;Neutral;Navigation    
I'm astonished, frankly, to be the first person to write a review here and if I'd seen others, I might have actually rated it a 5.;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
I am this app all year Great way to plot my ice fishing trips. Instead of plugging a bunch of holes and dropping my flasher I can pick out land marks and get close to where the fish should be. Saved me so much time and effort and got me fishing ;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Only downfall is I have had to buy this twice I just switched to iPhone and had to purchase it again. There should be a way to port it over.;Mis;Neutral;Navigation    
This is a great app for boating and fishing but it is missing one critical feature  the ability to import markerswaypoints.  There are other GPS and marine apps that have this feature.  I have many lists of GPS coordinates for fishing reefs and there is no way to import them into this app.;Usa;Negative;Navigation    
I can not say enough how valuable this app is. It's great for planning. Great as a backup electronic navigation device. I don't use it tied to electronics..only on its own. With this and a good case, on both my iPad and iPhone it's a goto thing;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Great to get a general layout of the lake. Depth contours can be a little off in their accuracy. If you can figure out which way it's off you're golden. Wanted to fish near a sand bar and stopped short of it on the map but was nearly on top of it. Had to reverse twenty feet or so to find the drop off which then said it should have been shallow again. Good to know where the real shallows and rocks are though.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Don't like how they eat up screen space advertising their other products. Please remove the ads. It is very annoying.;Usa;Negative;Navigation    
the new update is super dumb, why is it black and it just went down the toilet;Usa;Positive;Navigation    
The app works great for its intended purpose but it has a flaw that ruins it. For some reason they placed a very light colored link that easily blends into the background to something called openstreet. It is placed right in the middle lower section so almost every time you try to scroll your map, the link will get activated and it takes you to this website and away from your map. It is very worrisome if you are tracking your way points through a tough channel and suddenly your map is gone. I have the paid version of navionics too. If they could get rid of that stupid link it could be a great app.;Usa;Negative;Navigation    
Good app very accurate and is great for storing your favorite fishing holes.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
This is a very useful app with no bugs yet extremely detailed;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I like the app. Use it on iPad and iPhone for bass fishing while in the boat. But please, please, please add more icons for waypoints.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Literally the most beneficial fishing tool I have ever came across, specifically when targeting areas ice fishing, due to the fact that, unlike most chat plotters used on open water, most ice flashers do not have any means of navigation or topography. Simply pull out your phone and hop on the sled to quickly target designated contour areas and composition changes. An absolute game changer. Best part... ITS FREE. Why not spend the money on the rods we know your gonna buy anyways because when do we ever stop buying new fishing gear. I will also have you know this is the only app review I have ever written, due mainly because I'm pretty confident I use this app more then the text messaging and calling features on my phone.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Can't continue on tracks anymore and data sync is a pain. Please fix;Sup;Negative;Navigation   
This gives me exactly what I need for fishing. Contours of lakes. And I couldn't believe how many tiny lakes  on this app have contour data. It's extremely accurate. I ice fish and this saves me from having to drill tons of holes to find the depths And drop offs to fish. Also it's great to be able to download areas so that I don't need cellular coverage to use the maps. Well worth the 10 bucks. Thanks;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Can't say enough good things about this app. I boat a lot and always have this app running while I boat. Saved me from running into shallow water. I love looking at the saved tracks and reviewing my trips. Top speed, total distance traveled, ect. Works even where you don't have cell coverage. Just make sure you download the maps a head of time. I am part of an old boat club and recommend this app to everyone. I am amazed by this app every time I use it.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I love this app. I use it for ice fishing and camping a lot. I wish there was a better system for sorting and selecting which waypoints you want displayed on the map. Other than that this is a 105 star app;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I use this app all the time when I visit Charleston. Simple and easy for anyone to use. I highly recommend trying it;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Honestly if your a fisherman just spend the 10 dollars and you won't regret it one bit Not kidding either. I love this app and use it all the time;Mis;Positive;Navigation

This app is seriously messed up. The map contours never fit the outline of the lake and it constantly moves all over the place. It shows I'm going up to 2mph when I'm laying in my bed looking at it. I have a paid subscription and expect a working app Please fix asap;Usa;Negative;Navigation   
I stopped using my Garmin chart plotter because this is so much better. The sonar charts are unbelievably accurateto the foot all over the Chesapeake.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
This is a must have From the serious tournament fisherman to the weekend guy fishing from the shore. The map lines up well with actual features in the lake. I have recommended this app to 15 people and they find it as useful as I do. If there is one knock on this app it's the fact that you can only have 150 saved icons.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
We got lost in the marsh off the sc coast. I downloaded this and we were able to get to our destination and back to the boat ramp very easily. A must have if you don't know the area you are boating.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I find this app useful for freshwater lake navigation. It has some nice features that I really don't need or use, but would be useful for some boaters. A must have if you launch in unfamiliar areas.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I wished I checked the reviews on Navionics before I purchased.;Mis;Neutral;Navigation    
I have had this app for less than 24hrs and I have already found 3 lakes in my area michigans U.P. where I know for a fact because I've fished them there are shallow humps less than 4ft that are on my paper maps but not on these so called contour maps. To use these for navigation on a unfamiliar lake would be a big mistake. If you can't rely on these for navigation how helpful will they really be for fishing Bottom line is cross check the maps on this app with reliable maps from another source.;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
The new version rids the app of customizing what you see on the screen. I use this app on my iPhone 5s and the bloody marina icons crowd the screen real estate. If there is a way to choose what you want to see on your screen, please tell me. This is a huge downfall for me. Give it those options and I'd rate it a 5 star.;Usa;Positive;Navigation    
I take my ski from Orange County to Avalon, CA all the time. I have been in very thick fog before however, the app makes following a direction very easy.;Mis;Positive;Navigation

Cheaper apps give headscourse up on my Ipad What's wrong with Navionics. Strange group.;Mis;Negative;Navigation    
Don't buy this app until they fix the sync feature.  Without it the app is pretty useless. On writing Navionics about why I could no long sync with my Raymarine they basically told me to go to hl. Also they are some how blocking reviews on their other produces so that customers can't see how much they screwed us.;Sup;Negative;Navigation   
Just upgraded and lost the ability to sync with E125. I have spent hours trying to get it to work. Sent three emails to support no answer. If I has a way to cancel the charge I would. Don't upgrade until this is fixed.;Sup;Negative;Navigation   
This app is far and away better than any other navigation app that I have seen. I am having trouble getting all the data from my iPhone to sync with my iPad. Do I have to pay again to get the data on my iPad which leads me to where the heck can I find an owners manual or user guide so I can really become familiar with this wonderful app;Sup;Positive;Navigation   
Overall, it is still worth every penny. It's even easier to use than my on board Garmin;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
When I open up an archived Track so I can track back running my boat thru a narrow shoal area in the dark, it just plays the previous track, and doesnt show me where I am so that I can stay on my previous track and not go off into the shallow, rocky areas.  I would now like a way to convert a saved Track to a Route.;Usa;Positive;Navigation   
I just updated my Navionics USA app and lost my ability to look at satellite photos of the areas in which I kayak. The new app is totally useless for kayaking in mangroves. I need to get the old app back.;Usa;Negative;Navigation    
This is a great app.  I use it for everyday boating around my favorite Texas lake.  Contour and depths seem to be accurate, but buy the additional map upgrades so you can input current water level each time you go out.  One issue  please fix the issue of losing depth shading when map is in overlay mode.;Usa;Positive;Navigation  
I have used practically every system. This is the cheapest, effective way to safely navigate a vessel out there. I recommend it to all of my students and all mariners operating on navigable water.;Mis;Positive;Navigation

I spend most of my time fishing along the east coast of Florida in a 20' CC. I thought about buying an expensive GPS unit for my boat but found that Navionics does all that I need. What sold me on this App I put in at a very little off the chart boat ramp one afternoon to go shrimping and the channel out was marked by PCV pipes with shallows on either side.  Coming in well after sunset I could not find these little PVC markers so, Navionics to the rescue I just followed my out bound Track right back in. It put me between these little PCV markers that I could not even see until I was passing them.  Worth every penny and saved me hundred of dollars. No need for a GPS unit. ;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I use it every time I'm on the water. It's like a water gps in your hand, you can always know the depth of the water before u drive over it.   It's especially great for new lakes bc u don't have to fear unsafe shallow spots.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
This is the best all around fishing app.  All maps all depths and so much more.  Almost makes me not need my depthfinder;Mis;Positive;Navigation

Ever since I updated to the new version I have had nothing but problems. Very very slow to load and when it does it is Constantly  locking up. I liked the old version where I could just have a lakes layer with no background. Now I can't  get rid of the background map like I could on the old version. It shows I should be able to turn the photo back ground off but when I do this I lose the lakes as well. Oh yeah and well over half the time the contours are not showing up  Wish I could get my money back;Per,Usa;Positive;Navigation   
I have 3 navionics chips and this download is still a must.  Great for scouting and more;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
My buddy and I use navionics for our iPhones. I would like to be able to send him my waypoints for fishing and vice versa. The app is great.  With that feature it could be a lot better.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
This app is very easy to use. You can download the map on your phone so in the case that you don't have cell phone coverage you can still see where to go. The overlay option is really nice you can see what other people have to say about everything from where the fish are to thin ice to the best bait shops in the area. For the price you can't go wrong. I would recommend it to anyone who fishes;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I just moved to Southern Wisconsin and this has been great for finding lakes, boat ramps and lake topo's  I like how you can mark spots where fishing has been good and making fishing notes.  It's nice to get info from other fisherman willing to post good spots to hit  Thanks for the affordable price that covers all the States;Mis;Positive;Navigation

Functions that should be the most simple and intuitive creating standalone waypoints or markers as this program calls themare unnecessarily difficult.

I bought the original ap for around 50.  It is useless since the IO7 updates.  Navionics didn't offer a patch but require you to buy the new ap.  I called Navionics and questioned them about upgrading the older ap and they told me that ITunes store required a new purchase.  This is total BS.  I have spent over 1,000 on the Navionics SD cards and Navionics Planner software and then they treat their customers like crap.  I hope LakeMaster is watching and will provide a comparable product in the near future.  I'm through with Navionics;Sup;Positive;Navigation    
I've used the original navionics app then today I go to use it and it tells me it's not compatible with io7 7 Instead of offering a patch or upgrade they make you buy the app again. Total BS;Sup;Positive;Navigation    
Great app but when you go to zoom in it crashes.;Dep;Positive;Navigation   
Works very well showing your location, speed, direction, beacons, and other useful info. Trusting the Noah navigation charts it uses means your trusting Noah which is the industry standard for water depths. Thinking I'll upgrade to the sonar maps option for 4 more just to get the extra info. Thats 14 total. Thanks Navionics very nice water navigation phone app. I use it in the Houston Galveston area for recreational boating.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
The map is very detailed and very accurate. The touch interface of my iphone 5 makes it easier to use over my Lawrence system. Tracking features are nice. I did do an in app purchase and upgraded to auto route. This is a neat feature but not necessary. Basically put in your boats draft and it calculates the fastest route within a safe depth.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I payed over 30 for the original version of this app which doesn't even exist in the App Store any more. Instead of a regular app update they instead have abandoned the original app and require one to purchase this new app That's BS, especially now that the old app won't run for more than a minute without crashing with no hope for an update.;Dep;Positive;Navigation    
I finally upgraded to the new version of this app because of iOS 7. I like many of the features. However, I'm still getting used to nuances with zooming. Also, my biggest issue so far is the text.  It is very difficult to read. Setting the easy view option makes the text bigger, but it also makes all the symbols too big. Why wasn't the font from the old app used It was bolder, antialiased, and much easier to read.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Navigation   
This app does it all link it between your new wifi units with Navionics chip and Navionics app to plan routes and mark waypoints and us Navionics sync to transfer between each other.  Would recommend adding the in app upgrades to get Navionics  for all the freshest data for a year and the newest addition the sonar charts.  With the advances and continual updating of the charts well worth the money.  If you like plotting routes I would recommend you add the navigation module along with autorouting option.  You can't go wrong for the price  Like I said best navigation and chart app in the apple App Store;Mis;Positive;Navigation

All of these new features are way cool. If you want a static chart buy a map. If you want the best data available pony up the 4.99 you are getting all the charts for US Lakes  Coastal.  With the new NAV update you receive 12 months of chart updates, and SonarChats. SonarCharts is data that is collected by doing Sonar logs wHumminbird or Garmin chart plotters.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
A waste of money. Glitchy, twitchy and inaccurate. Constant hounding to buy upgrades that SHOULD BE INCLUDED UPDATES WHEN YOU BUY A 10 app;Dep,Usa;Negative;Navigation   
If you are looking for detailed depth contours this is not for you. I expected detailed contours but not even close. What makes it worse is that when on the water the contours are way off. ;Dep;Negative;Navigation    
I do like the community edit feature where others can post structure and hot spots but few are willing to share. ;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
When I contacted customer support about lack of contours they stated that Sonar Charts may be included in future updates. Sonar Charts are AWESOME Very high detailed contours and extremely accurate. Unfortunately this feature is only available with the depth finder chips.  ;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
With Sonar Charts as a feature of this app I would pay triple. ;Mis;Negative;Navigation   
Navionics, thanks for trying but please work on adding Sonarcharts. Better yet enable communication between my depth finder with Navionic chip and this app and you have a real winner;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Was surprised to find Jordanelle Reservoir in Utah still not included opened 20 years ago.;Mis;Positive;Navigation

The only reason I have it 4 stars is because the iPad version doesn't have course up yet.  ;Sup;Neutral;Navigation    
I use this app on 2 iPads and my iPhone. It's amazing how you can sync tracks and routes. I've been on my friends boats and used it to tell them how to get somewhere. It's absolutely amazing for planning trips. Again, being able to store all the locations is great. I can pull up any location along with current wind, tide, currents, etc. anytime. ;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
The detail is much better than most hard wired chart plotters. ;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
The reviews are specific to small issues. You have to get the lake version if you want lakes. Auto routing is kind of nice but I could definitely so without. These little things don't merit a 12 star rating. Buy this app. You won't regret it. And, no, I'm not affiliated with the company at all. I just love this app. All the guys on my dock are using it now too.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I thought it would have the depths of the lakes It only has it for the ocean.;Mis;Neutral;Navigation    
The original app is GREAT Don't waste your money on the auto routing upgrade. You still need to enter waypoints. That doesn't make it automatic.;Mis;Positive;Navigation

The review below originally had one star. Navionics actually resolved the issue and emailed to inform me. WOW;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
This app is great with plenty of features such as the newly added auto routing.  Recently add ons have been released quite frequently.  The ONLY thing this app lacks is headup that isn't based on the inaccurate iPhone compass heading.  If it used the same method the app uses to point the arrow on the map, it would be perfect.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
The app itself is very good. The auto routing update does not work and kept freezing up. It also casused my iphone 4 to crash and have not been able to restore. Stay far away far away.;Sup;Positive;Navigation   
Awesome app in general Get it well worth it. Minus one star for the new Auto routing inapp purchase...  not as nearly as useful as I had hoped. I expected it to at least follow Navigation rules. And yes boat settings are set correctly. I regret spending money on this inapp purchase . The auto route had me going across sand bars and islands Needs some serious tweaking;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
Great but many lakes in SD and MN are not correct for depth. Please fix Then would be a 5 star app.;Dep;Positive;Navigation  
There is no longer an option to adjust current lake depth. This feature is a must have so please add it.;Usa;Positive;Navigation    
App functions properly and has good menu options. The one huge downfall is that you cannot zoom in far enough to have a good idea what depth your at. Example fishing rivers or lakes with steep dropoffs.;Usa;Positive;Navigation    
Have used this app for years.  Upgraded to iPhone 5 and the latest operating system.  Then Navionics provided an update.  Now it won't run.  It crashes on startup every time.  Works on my iPad.  Unfortunately, I don't always have my iPad with me when I am am talking fishing with my friends.  My iPhone is there.;Dep,Sup;Positive;Navigation   
I'm not sure what happened.  It was working fine, and then one day decided to crash.  I've deleted and reloaded the app several times.  It works for the first time, and then after I've navigated away from it, I can't relaunch.  It looks like it starts, and then crash.;Dep;Negative;Navigation

Marked a spot ice fishing and could not get back on the structure using this app.  The crib was on the map but way off and my actual GPS location was off as well.  Made it impossible to find my spot again.;Dep;Positive;Navigation   
I bought the 5 in app upgrade because everything navionics has done so far has been great. This was a waste. They add some minor functionality that available for free in several other places. This better not be an indicator of things to come.;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
It's a pitty that app functionality updates such as the nav module and advanced map options are extra. ;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
Overall it's a great app. You can study the lake wherever your at. I have navionics on my boat, computer, iPad, and iPhone. The only downfall of this app is that the iPhone won't sync waypoints. Apparently at one time it did because I do have some on the iPhone that are on other devices too but I guess one of the navionics updates might have messed it up.;Sup;Negative;Navigation  
Got lost out in the river in the thickest fog I'd ever seen. This app is the ONLY reason we made it home. We drove in circles out there for an hour and a half before I finally found this and purchased it. Worth every penny.;Mis;Negative;Navigation

Great app however, I boat on the upper Niagara River and Lake Erie. Since both these waters are an international boarder, there is no coverage of Canadian waters. It would be great if these boarder areas were included.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
Caveat emptor as app uses true not magnetic for course and direction. If you are in an area of high magnetic variation and do not account for it manually then you will miss your mark. Remember 1 degree of course error in 60 miles is 1 mile.;Mis;Negative;Navigation    
I've been using this app to navigate from the Chesapeake Bay area down to Florida and love it I'm delivering a 50 foot catamaran and the electronics on board are useless. I've had to rely on this app on both my iPhone and iPad and it had been extremely helpful. The ease of use is great, accuracy has not been a problem, and pulling into new inlets every night has been easy with this app. ;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
It does have a few issues. I use the track quite often to see the days progress. The problem is I leave the app running in the background and it usually crashes about twice a day. When it does this the track line is connected with a dotted line to show what it missed, which is great. However, the information at the end of the day is not correct due to it keeps the same start time, but only tells the tracks distance from the last startup point. This makes the total distance, average speed, and fuel consumption way off. ;Dep;Positive;Navigation   
I purchased this app on a fishing trip in Michigan's upper peninsula. I used it a couple of times and found it to be quite accurate and helpful. On the third outing we had a dense fog roll in and that's when I found out just how useful it can be.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I was able to stay clear of shallow waters and navigate a route back to our lodge. The soundings correlated with my fish finder which made motoring much easier.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I would recommend this to anyone looking for a navigational aid. As a note, not all lakes show contours, but I think you'll find most, if not all, popular lakes listed.;Mis;Negative;Navigation   
I use the app on iphone  ipad reference at home for planning.  On the kayak, use it for trips.  Works great.  Easy to expand map for little creeks a kayak can enjoy.

The app functions well, but upon checking the soundings where I work, in New York harbor and where I live, in Annapolis, I found them to be wildly inaccurate. It shows 3 feet if water where the U.S. Sailboat show is currently setting up deepdraft boats for display. In New York harbor, it shows less than 20 feet of water in Northern Stapleton anchorage, where deepdraft ships are anchored. Don't rely on the soundings.;Dep;Positive;Navigation

I am impressed with this program. It works very well for a back up to my full system and for the price I think it is well worth it.

Don't buy the app and think you've got the content, it's just an app.  The map downloads are free until updated, but they must be downloaded separately.  If you try to use the app without a wifi connection you'll find yourself needing to download 100MB of maps over your cell connection, or worse.;Mis;Negative;Navigation    
There should be an easy way to say download all and get all the maps you've paid for in one step.  Then you could do that at home and forget about it.;Usa;Positive;Navigation    
Sweet app out of the box on my 3GS. I was looking for depth charts for the Tennessee river lakes in North Alabama Guntersville, Wheeler, Wilson, and Pickwick. I'm glad I ignored most of the negative reviews. Within minutes I had 500 MB of charts downloaded covering a large chunk of the southeast at no added cost. Resolution is great and accurate so far according to my sonar. Community overlays are a sweet feature too. App also allows overlays of mapping services Google, Bing, etc. Great app so far, and well worth 10. Now I don't need to spend 20 per lake for paper maps;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I purchased one of their charts and when I got a new Iphone I could not locate the App in the purchased and Not on this phone section. The chart was fine.

What I really got it for is to track and save routes, that I take with different fishing buddies and I can say that it was worth every cent.  You really don't need gps on your boat of you have this app.  But, it's nice to have both and this one is portable and you can even save routes that a guide took you on , with out him even knowing.  Tracking routes in shallow water is very important, bc when you try to go back to a spot someone else took you, you will find out they know those waters well and make it look easy.  This is where this app comes most handy for me.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
US map only has half the Great Lakes including Detroit River.  No more apparent detail than previous versions and Internet is required to download details.  No upgrade path and customer service is useless.  Old version is better but not great either.  Leaves me wishing they could get this right  maybe Lakemap can get something together.  An ipadiphone dual version would be nice since I would hate to pay twice for a bad app.  Support for older maps is horrible and upgrade offers little reward.;Sup;Negative;Navigation

Good app  will definitely use IF the registration process ever works.

I am a fisherman for inland lakes.   This is a gem of an app.  It has a high level of functionality and is as handy as your iPhone.  I find it very useful.  I use it a lot when fishing with friends in their boats.  I can mark a spot and transfer it later to my boat's GPS.  I have also used it, with the guide's permission, to record waypoints when on a guided trip.   It also works excellent when navigating to waypoints.  It gives you a current heading while under way and I have found it to be very accurate, both in recording waypoints and also finding spots.   I also feel secure having a backup to my main navigation GPS when on my boat that is potent enough to get'r done if I were to need it for something critical like finding your way out of some of the jungles in Texas lakes.   This is a HIGH value app at 10.;Mis;Positive;Navigation

I bought this app last spring and used it for fishing on 5 or 6 lakes in N Texas.  This is a great app for the price. I used it more prior to fishing to mark spots etc.. Once on the lake, It took me right to the spot I picked out and I could also mark a spot for future reference. The only real problem I had was if you mark say a good Crappie hole on the map, everybody who has this app now knows exactly where ur spot is.  For the price, not a bad app. Use it w a depth  fish finder and it will guide u to ur location.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
This is based off the less than great iPhone gps so it will be off a little but it has so many lakes and waterways in it. I use it all the time Great app;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I should have read the reviews.  If I used this as planned I would hit rocks that appear on the sd version of the product.  The sd chip slides into my garmin and is wonderful.  The NOAA charts have more details then this.   Waiting for refund;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
The maps on this new version are horrible. I suspect they lost their license to the more detailed ones.  Very disappointing. Need it fixed;Usa;Negative;Navigation    
I purchased this last year and used it a few time.  App was great. Found some unmarked underwater structure that wasn't showing on another product.  Since they have come out with a couple of updates.  Well I just opened the app for ice fishing only to see they took off virtually all the contour lines.  For 10 maybe this is what the app should have been, but this app now is NOT what I paid for.  I will not buy anything from navionics again because of what they did with the customers.  At the very least they should have left the app alone for all that had previously purchased it.;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
Absolutely love this app. Well made and easy to use. I would recommend to any boating enthusiast.;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
I just got the app, takes a little while to understand, but overall it's pretty good. Also, not sure really sure how accurate it is. To me it doesn't seem to be worth 10;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
By far the best charts of all the marine applications ;Mis;Positive;Navigation   
The GPS routes, markers and way points need work. While in route, the display is missing ETA to way point and heading in degrees while your on the chart screen. It only shows speed and distance.;Usa;Negative;Navigation    
While you can create waypoints, it lacks an easy MARK button. Please add this to the screen. ;Usa;Positive;Navigation    
While you can create routes, you can't use your waypoints for your route without remarking the spot over again with a number.;Usa;Positive;Navigation    
Hopefully they will work on these issues with future updates.;Mis;Positive;Navigation    
I was at one point happy with this map until Navionics tricked me into updating my downloaded maps . The original maps showed detailed contours and lake structure. I followed a Navionics update notification and the new maps have awful lake contours and inaccurate structure placement. Do not buy if you are looking for an ethical and accurate app and seller;Dep,Usa;Positive;Navigation   
Lake Marion, SC map is has glitches in the contour. Just thought I would let you know about the issues.;Dep;Neutral;Navigation   
I love this app, I'm a dive instructor in the fl keys and I use it often. But my biggest complaint is that the map overlays won't stay visible, when u resize the map they appear for a bit then go away... It's a bit disappointing since the google maps overlay makes the reefs visible.;Usa;Negative;Navigation   
I've been having way too much fun playing songs on this app. So easy to use;Mis;Positive;Music   
Well, first those 5star reviews may have never tested other cloud players. Most of them have dropbox integrated.;Mis;Positive;Music    
why just 1star rating;Mis;Neutral;Music    
No ability to stream online. You need to download. Please add this ability. Disappointed;Usa;Positive;Music    
Please add intuitive user interface, navigating is a big mess;Usa;Negative;Music    
THIS IS APP IS AMAZING. It lets you do all the features of Spotify but for free, unlimited skips, offline music and very simple and smart interface. I always use this app to listen to my music because I can access my music from any device now because it is one Dropbox. The Dropbox music download process is really quick and efficient. I really suggest this app if you want to listen to offline music.;Mis;Positive;Music   
It's an amazing app, and as it says that it works without wifiinternet needed... it is true. How do I know Because I tried it, i went to an area I had no signal in and the music stayed on without freezing or anything.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I was trying to find a way how to move all my music i had on my andriod to my new iphone and there was no way but finally this app help this app is beast;Mis;Positive;Music   
I use it to listen to my Podcasts from Patreon. It works great for that and it's very easy to use and import files.;Mis;Positive;Music   
Easy to add music Dropbox, easy to make playlists, easy and very simple controls. The very best;Mis;Positive;Music   
I would highly recommend this app, it is the best alternative to buying music on your phone. The only problem is that when you get a new phone you have to download and rename all of the music you have, which takes a very long time. You should be able to make an account.;Mis;Positive;Music   
This app is great best music app to date and so easy to use. Finally an app o can have any song I want on. All I wish for is a shuffle option for my songs;Mis;Positive;Music   
Offline music is great. But it skips some songs so plzz fix that. But other than that its good.;Mis;Positive;Music

This app is awesome it's the best thing that's ever happened to my iPhone. I just put whatever music I want into my dropbox folders, and then to appears on my phone Jukebox is the greatest app ever. You have to get this please do yourself this favor get this application... I don't care what anyone else says iTunes is garbage. Jukebox ... oh my god... I Jukebox is the future of iPhone's music. Free yourself from the slavishness of the iTunes model.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I downloaded it before but I didn't have wifi so it took so dang long I had 3G internet.;Mis;Neutral;Music

Very easy to use, works well.;Mis;Positive;Music   
After my experiences with Cloudbeatsanother similar app to Jukebox, I've found that Jukebox overall is better than Cloudbeats. Jukebox's simple design and structure is what differentiates this app from competitors.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I love the app you can play music offline. Just input it into Dropbox and you can input it into the app it best app better than ripped off iTunes;Mis;Positive;Music   
Perfectly solved a problem I had  how to make my music accessible from virtually anywhere. Could use some more playback features but overall works great;Mis;Positive;Music   
Unlimited offline music streaming. What more can you ask for;Mis;Negative;Music   
I have always disliked the iTunes interface. iTunes has always been and still is unintuitive. Every time I try to transfer music I have to figure out how to accomplish the task, never can I remember. By far the easiest way to transfer music to the iPhone and listen to music files and albums. The simplicity of this app is amazing.;Mis;Positive;Music   
If your like listening to albums and like using folders to organize your music albums this is great. I am not a fan of playlist and this serves me well.;Mis;Positive;Music   
This is what is called simply beautiful. App works like a charm while being very minimalistic. Definitely recommend;Mis;Positive;Music

I love this app. It is simple, fast, convenient,  a life saver  ;Mis;Positive;Music   
I've been using a multitude of apps for music with not many successes. This app has proven itself to be the best one yet. It's easy to use, convenient, reliable, and quick.

After spending hours upon hours on end, and speaking to countless Technical support reps. I was able to find exactly what I was looking for since I do not use iTunes...for a variety of reasons. It was easy and simple to download from Dropbox. Now, I do not have to worry about having slow internet on my flight tomorrow  cause you can use jukebox in airplane mode I gave it 4 stars because I want to make sure it will work for a while. If it does I will gladly bump it up to 5 stars.;Mis;Positive;Music

I would change the reading once you fix the issue with the app crashing during shuffle. Otherwise exactly as expected. A superior app for MP3. ;Dep;Positive;Music   
Thank you for developing the perfect app. Thanks again;Mis;Positive;Music   
The sound quality is good and it is useable offline;Mis;Positive;Music   
The only thing I don't like is that on shuffle it repeats the songs I already listened to. I hate that when I skip a song it eventually goes right back to it. Please change that and I'll change my review to a 5 star;Usa;Negative;Music    
This app is Great Definitely worth getting;Mis;Positive;Music   
Very easy to use, highly recommended. Enough features for a casual music listener like me.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I did not expect this app to really work, but I stand corrected.;Mis;Neutral;Music   
I'm currently using this app to create playlists to listen to at work. No complaints... this is quality code  I'd give 5 stars if the app could play from Dropbox without importing to my phone.;Sup;Positive;Music   
I downloaded this, tired of using different music apps. This is a great app, it downloads to your phone and syncs perfectly to your dropbox. Love it;Mis;Positive;Music   
It works as advertised so that's great.  A couple of key things I'd like to see;Mis;Positive;Music   
Save where I am in a file.  If I have a long running song and pause it won't retain where I was if I leave the app for awhile. ;Dep;Positive;Music   
The ability to speed up the playback like podcasting app.;Mis;Positive;Music    
Very convenient, great layout, and easy to use Recommended for anyone who wants to download songs from one device to your phone.;Mis;Positive;Music   
This app is amazing. I love how easy it is to use. The only thing that could make it a little bit better is the ability to type the lyrics in and have them scrollable while listening to the song. Other than that, thank you for being the only music app on iPhone that lets me use music from my Dropbox.;Usa;Positive;Music   
Sometimes the app skips songs when shuffle isn't on, as in it plays the first second of it and then skips it. Also, using Shuffle always ends up with the same songs and sometimes a certain song is never heard during that time.;Usa;Positive;Music   
Hi I really love this app a lot It's so simple to import music I wondering if you could add an equalizer, and tempo and pitch adjusters Please Thanks for the awesome app;Mis;Positive;Music   
It's actually a really good app;Mis;Positive;Music   
I can't get past the screen where it searches for audio files in my Dropbox. The little circle just keeps spinning. I finally downloaded another app that worked.;Dep,Usa;Neutral;Music

This is what I was looking for... Still I wish it could read aac format as well, not just mp3. Please support more audio formats.;Usa;Positive;Music    
Could be a problem on my end but I've reinstalled a few times on my 6s and it always gets stuck on the initial importing screen...;Sup;Negative;Music   
Doesn't keep the files in order even if they're properly alphabetized. Skips files too. ;Sup,Usa;Neutral;Music  
Fixing this problem would boost my review to 5 stars.;Mis;Neutral;Music    
Quite possibly the best Music app on the iphone period;Mis;Positive;Music   
No ads, simple and clean UI, completely free. Saves music to your device for offline use  dropbox is simply the method of transfer. Files must be mp3 format. Great app.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I had a album with multiple  artists. Basically every song was made by a different person and the app decided to label every song as its own album. While it's fine because I just made it into a playlist, it'd be nice if the app didn't do that.;Usa;Positive;Music   
Can no longer change songs from appleWatch. Please update for Watch support. Hasn't been updated since May.;Sup;Positive;Music   
I love the idea of how songs can be downloaded via one's Dropbox account. Just a thought that having imports additionally from Google or any other cloud storage solution would make the app a lot more valuable;Sup;Positive;Music   
This is an awesome app for my commute because I can listen to my music offline and there's no ads;Mis;Positive;Music   
A good app for playing music from Dropbox, but it skips music when shuffle is on and stops playing when repeat is on sometimes. I don't know if this only happens to me but I would appreciate a better update.;Dep,Sup;Positive;Music   
I love this app and it is THE BEST when it comes to cloud related music apps It's the least sketchy and works SUPER WELL. If you want free music but your a cheapskate like me  this is the app ;Mis;Positive;Music

Only app I've found where I can easily move music from my Dropbox to this app and listen with no ads or pop ups and I can also rename my songs with title and artist which is nice ;Mis;Positive;Music   
Great, but would be even better with an equalizer ;Mis;Positive;Music   
It's great, it's easy to use and fun.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I love this app. Discovered it after having issues with the new iTunes not syncing right on my 5S and have not looked back. My screen got damaged so I went back to my 4S while I wait or the replacement screen and digitizer to come in.  The auto format script is off a bit and I don't have shuttle controls any where but the lock screen. Please fix this. Or tell me how to.;Sup,Usa;Positive;Music  
I use it in my classroom for transitional and independent study time. It works as it should. Be aware though, it uses audio found in your Dropbox not your phone's memory.;Mis;Neutral;Music    
It just works I've loved it since the day I downloaded it from the app store. So grateful to the developers for making such a simple yet powerful app to manage all my audio in my dropbox folder. Thank you;Mis;Positive;Music

I really love this app only thing is, I wish you can change the album artwork thats why I give it a 4 instead of a 5, sue me  but overall this app is amazing and its NO ADS I RECOMMEND IT ;Mis;Positive;Music   
Yes....it actually wasn't a waste of time It plays offline Finally I found something that does THANK GOD.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I wanted to have all my music from Dropbox in one place so I could play it start to finish while driving around or just hanging out. This app made that so easy.;Mis;Positive;Music

I'm using the app to listen to audiobooks. Works great  just wish there was a way to create bookmarks in a playlist.;Mis;Positive;Music   
With the new iPhone update my phone wouldn't sync with iTunes because my Mac didn't support the new version of iTunes and this app saved my musical life  It has a few bugs here and there but I haven't been able to find a better app ;Sup;Positive;Music  
Useful app never liked them but this one is great;Mis;Positive;Music   
Thanks Great app  does he simple things well. Could use playlist improvement though. Repeat all etc;Mis;Positive;Music   
It is really useful and it is my first time using it and it works great;Mis;Positive;Music   
Amazing app that works exactly as advertised and has all the features one would expect such an app to have, as well as an amazing and easy to use UI. The only features I would love to see added are the ability to see the player itself without having to play a new song and an option to choose photos for your songs that appear in the player and lock screen.;Mis;Positive;Music   
It work like it is supposed to;Mis;Positive;Music   
F U Apple. I want to put music on my device on my terms.  Sign into your Dropbox through this app, and it scans your box for music files. Done   Thank you and good day sir;Mis;Positive;Music    
Allows me to easily move songs from Dropbox to play them. ;Mis;Positive;Music   
I just can't figure out how to play an album in order of track instead of alphabetical order.;Sup;Positive;Music    
Fantastic work a clean interface with no ads, what a great app. I recommend it to everyone;Mis;Positive;Music   
No easy playlist management e.g. can't add an album to a playlist, no queue function, player skips songs when listening to an album with no shuffle. These features are needed and add in the next update please. ;Usa;Negative;Music   
As a super basic player its decent, but if you plan on using it for a lot of stuff, it gets annoying really quick.;Usa;Negative;Music    
Love it Exactly what I was looking for. Now I don't ever have to worry about hooking my phone to a computer and syncing with iTunes. I can now do everything right from my phone and enjoy my music. Has maybe a bug or two, by not letting me play every song for some reason. But hey it's a start and better to be able to do it this way. Thumbs up.;Dep;Positive;Music  
I usually don't write reviews, but this app deserves it I have an iPhone, and while I love it for its built in music library, I've been having issues getting songs from my computer library synced to my phone. I can now take my downloaded songs, upload easily to Dropbox, and then jump on my phone and have Jukebox upload from there It's super quick, there are ZERO ADS, and I can listen wherever  whenever. Please don't ever go away, Jukebox;Mis;Positive;Music   
Would love the ability to arrange order of songs within a playlist.;Mis;Positive;Music    
NOT on shuffle the app skips certain songs sometimes within and album or playlist and sometime just jumps back to the beginning. Kinda weak;Dep;Negative;Music   
You can't rearrange tracks in a playlist. Seriously. Uninstalling ;Usa;Negative;Music    
This has been great app for the last 2 months I've used it but since about yesterday there has been an annoying problem. None of my files will play, load,etc. it just says error then skips to the next song. Please fix this problem;Dep;Negative;Music   
All I get are error messages when trying to get the app to connect with DropBox. I force restarted the phone uninstalled and reinstalled both DropBox and JukeBox and nothing. I wished this app would work because I hate having to keep my phone unlocked to listen to audio on DropBox. Hopefully this will get addressed in a future update.;Sup;Negative;Music   
I am angry and frustrated because I started downloading some more music and it wouldn't load, it wouldn't play the song, it keeps showing error. Please fix this problem ASAP;Dep;Negative;Music   
iTunes has gotten ridiculously annoying to sync, since they will erase my previous files to do so.  This app is exactly what I needed;Sup;Negative;Music    
It's a great app i was shocked when I first downloaded it, how easy it is to use and great it is for listening to music 1010;Mis;Positive;Music   
Just got the app a few minutes ago and I like it.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I love it I use it along with ifile organizer and Dropbox a bit of work around but hey I can add and play music on my iPhone 6 with out a computer;Mis;Positive;Music   
I'll tell you that I've spent hours trying to work with iTunes. I've had so many issues with syncing and managing my library. Jukebox is a fantastic tool to bypass iTunes and quickly get songs on your iPhone device. Bravo;Mis;Positive;Music   
Finally an app that does what is says plays nice and no ads Thank you;Mis;Positive;Music   
This is a beautifully designed app, no ads is heaven, a few bugs here and there but other then that it's perfect, there really isn't any customer service, I emailed 3 times and got no response;Mis;Positive;Music   
Yes..great app, free, no ads, you can listen all your music  in your iPhone without be in your iPhone. Some little bugs here and there but in general, great app. Thank you;Mis;Positive;Music   
Worst app ever I can't even download sht it asks for email and password;Mis;Negative;Music    
this app is really greats and I don't have any problems but I think that you should make an update to add album art;Mis;Positive;Music   
The shuffler is broken because it always replays the same music over  over again but other than that small fix I love it;Usa;Positive;Music  
This app is great and with the right setup you can download music from YouTube right on your phone. This app is easy to use and I use it every day. Amazing;Mis;Positive;Music   
There is no queuing function, and the shuffler is a bit broken since it would repeat songs before looping through the playlist.;Usa;Negative;Music   
I had an old app that I could directly use youtube to mp3 in and that was fantastic. It got taken off the app store so I lost all my music. This app is a great replacement. I can use iFile or a similar app to download a song, export it to dropbox, and then download it to Jukebox. It's a longer process, but it works just as well if not better.;Mis;Positive;Music   
Nothing better than music from your dropbox. Syncing your music to phone has never been easy. However the app still has some issues, esp. It crashes sometimes. Also there is no playpause control button on the program. Please consider to add them.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Music   
Just found the app on a recommendation and it takes Dropbox music storage up a notch. Complete control over files. Create playlists and even have album art;Mis;Positive;Music   
Jukebox is a wonderful app and it has helped me save data every month. There are just a few glitches I would like to point out, and if they were fixed this app would be perfect. First, sometimes when I'm shuffling songs jukebox will skip over a song and play the next song in line for no reason. Second, I would like to be able to swipe up from the bottom of my iPhone while I'm not in the app and switch the song this function never seems to work for me on jukebox. Thanks for this app and I hope these corrections will be implemented.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Music  
Really great app, 100 free, nice UX and no ads;Mis;Positive;Music   
Works well but I would like to be able to pause my music while my headphones are on. It's kinda annoying wanting and trying to pause it with my headphones and it doesn't. Also, sometimes it'll skip over some tracks in the album. Please fix that.;Dep;Positive;Music   
Great music player With no ads;Mis;Positive;Music   
Needs more features but the basics work great. Dropbox import works. random play needs some work.;Mis;Positive;Music   
Really good app, very clean and all that I wanted a music app to be. Especially because I can listen to my music without wifi;Mis;Positive;Music   
Love the app. When shuffling within a playlist it seems to repeat a lot of songs. No complaints otherwise;Mis;Positive;Music   
I just want to say that you make life easier by these pretty apps. Sincerely thamks for all your efforts again;Mis;Positive;Music   
MP3juices.cc is perfect for this app. I love this I have tried too many other apps and this app is perfect. I wouldn't recommend it if it weren't true  So please save yourself the hassle of going through multiple apps just to delete them and download this app now  I do agree with adding your own information and album art tho that would be great;Mis;Positive;Music   
maybe add lock screen controls fast forwarding and custom eq settings;Mis;Neutral;Music    
This app is just great. I have all my favorite songs on here and it's so easy to import more songs.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I don't think there are any problems with it personally. I put music into my Dropbox folder from YouTube MP3 and it works;Mis;Negative;Music   
Loaded but will not open. Very disappointing because I wanted to use it with dropbox. Updated iOS fixed it. Now use it and love it. Works well and is easy to upload my music. Wish playlists were easier to make.;Usa;Positive;Music   
First request..support for song art having the static 'J' on every song takes away from the experience. Second, please please please add support for Google Drive Thank you;Mis;Positive;Music    
Fantastic work on this app It's simple, clean, well designed and exactly what I've been looking for. It allows me to avoid the hassle of iTunes and the less than desirable builtin iPhone music player which is a beautiful thing. Also love that it plays wav files natively within the app. Bravo;Mis;Positive;Music   
I enjoy this app a lot because of how clean it is and all the features already in it but I would like to see a delete button for songs I don't want anymore. And I can't pause the music while I have headphones in, I have to go to the phones lock screen in order to pause it not withe the iPhone headphones. But I still do love this app thank you;Usa;Positive;Music   
This is a great, easy to use, and good looking app. I have one problem It is that I'm not sure if it's certain song but sometimes it just says an error has occurred while trying to play and skips a bunch of songs other then this great app;Dep;Positive;Music  
Perfect for playing Dropbox files very happy with it so far.;Mis;Positive;Music   
This music player is AMAZING No ads, no commercials, no glitches It's perfect ;Mis;Positive;Music   
BUT... Can You PLEASE add a song sorting option so we could change the order of the songs in a playlist Other than that Everything is AMAZING;Mis;Positive;Music   
ALSO, i have a BIG request and everyone who has ONEDRIVE cloud will agree with me too. CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE A MUSIC PLAYER JUST LIKE THIS ONE FOR ONEDRIVE OR PLEASE MAKE THIS APP SUPPORT ONEDRIVE ALSO;Mis;Positive;Music    
I love the concept, but the app just crashes and disappears on my phone. I have 68K tunes in Dropbox Business account, though, so it's understandable if disappointing.;Dep;Negative;Music   
I love this app, I really do, and I love the fact that I can listen to my music on it. However, sometimes it will bug out. Please find the problem and fix it because it gets a little annoying;Dep;Positive;Music   
It's great to be able to play my tunes offline. I used to use Spotify, but I never had premium and I was never able to get my clean versions. Saves the hassle of syncing my iPhone, just drop my songs into my Dropbox and have them ready to go. Worth the work to download my songs to the cloud. Thank you ;Mis;Positive;Music   
It's great but the flaw is the limited space on the app I wish you would update it so it would be unlimited so we could download songs as much as we want;Mis;Positive;Music   
This app is GREAT but there are a few thing I would like to see.. There should be an option to upload your own album art. Also, I'd love to see a scroller on the side so I can find my songs faster. While using the app, I noticed a few bugs. Whenever I'm listening to music and an alarm goes off when my ringer is on, the music stops completely and doesn't play unless I go back into the app and play it. It should automatically play again after I shut off the alarm. When a notification goes off when my ringer is on, the volume gets all messed up. It's either gets really low and doesn't go back to the setting that I had it at, or it randomly gets very loud. If you could please fix these things I would be more than happy to rate Jukebox 5 stars ;Dep,Usa;Positive;Music  
It's a great app, but I had to take off a star because whenever I try to edit a song the app crashes, I hope you guys are able to solve this problem;Dep;Positive;Music   
Would love to have an option to just select a folder and make the importing function search to just that one ;Mis;Positive;Music    
I couldn't open the app at all. It crashed every time I tapped on it. 010 would not fap again;Dep;Neutral;Music   
I like this app and how simple it is. However, it would be nice if this app integrated Google Drive also instead of only Dropbox.;Sup;Positive;Music   
Works perfect and can sync all my music from Dropbox ;Mis;Positive;Music   
So simple to use, and I just love how clean it looks. Works great;Mis;Positive;Music   
This app is hella good.. Able to convert songs from YouTube n save to my DropBox. Open my JukeBox and import the songs from DropBox... WaLa;Mis;Positive;Music   
Sadly I'm unable to use this app. I'm a musician so I have over 10,000 .wav files in my Dropbox and the app won't move past the import screen. ;Sup,Usa;Negative;Music    
App indicates that it's compatible with iOS 8.0 or higher. I have iOS 8.4 and this app won't starts. It worked on my other device that has iOS 9.2. Pls either fix the app or correct the inaccurate description.;Sup;Positive;Music   
This is great no ads at all. It doesn't crash, it's responsive and it's clean. Perfect;Mis;Positive;Music   
I like to put things in my drop box to hear later so I don't have to do it through iTunes but Dropbox sometimes pauses too much so this comes in clutch when I need it;Mis;Positive;Music   
No pop up ads, barely any ads for ratings and when you do see them, they aren't intrusive, easy to use, great design. Download this app.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I don't really like it because it won't let me use it.;Mis;Negative;Music    
This app is awesome, and gets many things right. First up, there are no ads, and before the app uses any cellular data it will ask to continue. In addition, the app won't spam you with annoying popups asking for a review, only a little banner at the top that shows up once in a blue moon;Mis;Positive;Music   
As for the 4 star rating, the app doesn't seem to have any form of shuffle button, which is a bit disappointing;Usa;Negative;Music    
Jukebox found music in my Dropbox I forgot was there And now I can listen to that music offline which is pretty sweet for my commute ;Mis;Positive;Music   
As long as you know how to get music to Dropbox then this is a great app;Mis;Positive;Music   
This app is sweet. I can listen to music whenever I want to without worrying about using up data and paying more  to the .;Mis;Positive;Music   
I hated iTunes, specifically because iTunes does not work with my MacBook and my MacBook won't connect with my phone... It's a long story. My only option to get music on my phone was to use Dropbox... I found Jukebox to be an excellent companion to Dropbox. Once I've transferred music over to Jukebox I remove my music from Dropbox to keep my usage at a minimum. ;Mis;Negative;Music   
My only wish now is if I could transfer music from Jukebox back to Dropbox in case I want to back it up on my computer.;Mis;Positive;Music    
Great app, great concept. I like the layout, it's very good. It's smooth but it could be smoother. They need to work on speed and stability but it's not horrible right now. Great app overall.;Per;Positive;Music   
I sent suggestion for developers of this app and in next update they do it ;Mis;Neutral;Music    
Trying to play music from Dropbox without ads is a pain, but this app makes it all go away Thank you;Mis;Positive;Music   
So far does everything I want it to.;Mis;Positive;Music    
A little buggy sometimes, but overall, a nice app;Dep;Positive;Music  
It would be a lot better if it had support for more cloud storages, like google drive or onedrive;Mis;Positive;Music    
I really like the idea of this app, but it's missing a few features, a queue, so you can shuffle the playing order, a shuffle all button, and a play next option. With the inclusion of these things, this app will be perfect But needs these features Great app nonetheless;Mis;Positive;Music   
Downloaded last version and it does not work. After update still can not load for iphone 5, ios 8.;Sup;Neutral;Music   
I have a quarter terabyte of files in Dropbox. This app can't get past the import stage. If I could just select a specific folder for audio, it probably would.;Usa;Neutral;Music   
I found this app amazing and haven't seen a bug so that's why I rated it 5 stars;Mis;Positive;Music   
Why can't we just select a specific folder to import;Mis;Neutral;Music    
I really like this app it does what they advertise. You can easily import music from your Dropbox account. They have now just implemented a new feature that lets you share music with friends that looks promising. Overall great app and user friendly.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I love this app, one of the best apps to listen to your songs offline also save a lot of space because the songs are .mp3, but when you're listening to the songs sometimes when a song is done the app skip the next song for example you have 3 songs, the 1st song is done so it starts the 3rd song instead of the 2nd idk why but that don't happen much so pls fix it, other than that the app is amazing D;Usa;Positive;Music  
This app is amazing I can use it everyday Thank you, but I wish I could just select all songs and put them in a playlist instead of having to manually tap on each song to put in in a playlist. Besides that, this app is great ;Usa;Positive;Music   
I only just started using this recently however I love it. I can store my songs online on Dropbox and play that music through jukebox. Super helpful, way more than I thought when I first downloaded it.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I don't understand how to login to this It tells me to log in or to open the jukebox app for a new account WHILE I'm in the app in the FIRST place. Ugh, confusing. ;Usa;Negative;Music    
Nice app. Please make for iPad UI. Keep it up;Mis;Positive;Music   
Love this app overall. No ads and offline listening is great, but the app needs more basic features such as editing abulm art, tags, etc. If these are added, this app will be the 1 dropbox music app on iTunes.;Mis;Positive;Music   
No privacy policy Even the developer website is barren of this information. It's an artist website to make music available to the masses.I just give a random developer my Dropbox password Do you monitor what I'm listening to What permissions does you app get Can the developers access my account or is the key stored locally Absolutely NO IDEA. BEWARE.;Dep;Negative;Music    
Once I play a wav file it crashes the app.  Does this app play wav files?;Dep;Positive;Music   
I love this app so much more cheaper then paying for all your songs though the Apple Music app. Only one problem that I hope they look into is putting a whole bunch of songs in a playlist instead of doing it individually. But other than that great app;Mis;Positive;Music   
It has a habit of skipping every other song which is perfectly fine except I think in shuffle, it doesn't even play those songs. I really wish it didn't do that but for a free app that doesn't have to do with iTunes, it's superb;Usa;Positive;Music   
This app is an excellent one so far. I love how well quickly it grabs music from my Dropbox and I the simple dark interface is amazing. However, I noticed that the app isn't compatible with the controls on my Apple lightning earpods and I also noticed that it tends to miss a few songs from the Dropbox folder here and there. Also the home screen controls tend to act funny from time to time. All in all, though, this is a must have app and I hope to see more improvements in the future.;Sup,Usa;Positive;Music  
This app is incredibly good and stuff but you guys should add more sorting features and just more features in general Gotta update this Great app though.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I was looking for an app that would let me create playlists from music in my Dropbox, and this is it There was a slight glitch before I created my first playlist, but I restarted the app  chose a song to start a playlist after that it is smooth sailing. Sure, there are a couple of things missing  for instance, I can't sort by artist  but for my needs it is PERFECT.;Mis;Positive;Music  
I've been looking for a clean UI music player that wouldn't constantly try and discover and recommend new songs based off my tastes.  All I wanted was a player that could download my music off Dropbox and play it  simple as that.  Jukebox does exactly that and is what I have been looking for.  Thank you;Mis;Positive;Music   
Thank you. I have been looking for an app to just simply play my music and teaching audio files. Most are over complicated, and honestly are hard to deal with.  I also don't want streaming music. For that there's Pandora or a host of other apps.  This app is elegant and does exactly what I have been looking for. Thanks;Mis;Positive;Music   
From the playlists to the organing options to the offline use...Top 20 app...hope it stays around.;Mis;Negative;Music   
The only reason I'm not giving this Five Stars is because there's a lock and key in the amount of space I can use. Even after clearing up most of my phone space there's no change.;Usa;Negative;Music   
So far, I love this app and will change my rating upon an update. It's easy to use and import songs.  BUT.. and it's a big but.. without the ability to scrub playback forwards or backwards, or at least go backforward 10 seconds or so with a button, it's very hard as a music professional to learn, makes charts for, or quickly critique mix issues of songs. Dropbox is primarily a storage or file share app not a music player per se. So having playlist ability is awesome but we need to be able to rewind or at least see a useable, selectable timeline for this to be a truly great app.;Usa;Positive;Music   
Works flawlessly. Saves me from spending all of my data in 2 days.;Mis;Positive;Music   
Best offline music player I have tried. Superfast at downloading my music from dropbox. I just wish that it would always stay with the shuffle on. I also wish that the playpause buttons would be bigger and that on the lock screen the time would show up larger and not be tiny at the top of the screen. But the shuffle always on is a bigger issue for me because I like it on shuffle.;Usa;Positive;Music   
Now that apple only has Apple Music I found it hard to listen to all my downloaded music. And with JukeBox and DropBox it's so easy and beautiful;Mis;Positive;Music   
I've been searching a long time for a free app that downloads music and can play without an internet connection. The extra work of converting the video files to MP3 files in Dropbox is worth it. Plus, there are no advertisements randomly poping up all over the place.;Mis;Positive;Music   
Largely clean and simple UI compared with recent iTunes versions. Still has an unnecessary and undesired clickbait link in the UI to 'discover more music' that links out to some external app in the store for download.;Usa;Positive;Music    
Import from dropbox worked well with a small number of test songs, but trying to get it to import 100s of additional songs all normal unprotected mp3 has lead to weird seemingly random import behavior getting just a song or two from each album folder across several dozens of artists and albums never importing in entirety. ;Usa;Negative;Music   
Also when importing, if you deselect all potential imports there is a trap in the UI from which you can't get back to main lib menu, requiring a force close of the application.;Usa;Negative;Music   
This app has potential, but it's not the simple iTunesAmazon Musicpersonal cloud killer many if us are looking for.;Mis;Negative;Music    
It's the best way to obtain free music. It works very well on my 6S and I've had little to no problems. Easy to use and an all around great app;Mis;Positive;Music   
the app is really smooth working and plays great the only complaint i have is it skips over songs quite alot but other than that i love it;Usa;Positive;Music  
I'm assuming most of the 'features' currently lacking will be added over time I.e. File type support, better library management. For now this app allows for a iTunes decoupling, which is plenty.;Mis;Positive;Music   
PLEASE ADD ANIMATED BACKGROUNDS;Mis;Positive;Music    
Thanks, now I can listen to music and download my own stuff from Dropbox with out a dumb music subscription. Genius. 1010;Mis;Negative;Music   
It's the best app I've had to download and play music for free, but I wish it would let us upload the album covers because the J just doesn't look fitting. That's just my opinion though. Other than that, it's great.;Usa;Positive;Music   
So easy to listen to my music from Dropbox  first app to do exactly what I wanted;Mis;Positive;Music   
I mean, Titanplayer was more direct and all, but it's sorta kinda gone. This app's pretty simple and clean and ohso very worth it, even if I need to go that extra mile and change videos to mp3s and move that to Dropbox and from Dropbox to here. There's only two teeny little problems the little pause button on the earbuds doesn't seem to register when I press it, and that little flashy headphone icon doesn't seem to have any way of turning off the multicolor flashing. Aside from that, this app is nearly perfect.;Usa;Positive;Music  
I like this better than Spinrilla or any other app cause it's like an android but it's not...;Mis;Positive;Music   
iPhone 6s, current iOS. Skips over songs mp3s in a playlist. Usually around the 6th or 7th track. Imported from Dropbox. Also, would be nice to change the songs in the playlist, and delete them. Thanks.;Usa;Positive;Music   
Super clean and a simply beautiful app.  I began saving my music through Dropbox a few months ago.  I kept trying to find an app that I could listen to my music with but they just weren't right.  That is until two weeks ago I found this app and it has been my saving grace Honestly the best no doubt I will definitely recommend this to others.;Mis;Positive;Music   
Using Dropbox to sync audio is invaluable. The restrictive nature of the apple platform is broken apart by this app. I love it. Use it all the time.;Mis;Positive;Music   
I was looking for a app and didn't expect it to be better than the Apple Music but it is;Mis;Positive;Music   
Does the job the right way without introducing any bits of complexity.;Mis;Neutral;Music   
My only suggestion is to make the layout look more like iTunes or music player.;Usa;Positive;Music    
i dont know what id do without it. my only concern however is that whenever i am playing music from jukebox and i get a phone call, i have to close and reopen the app to play music once again. i would greatly appreciate it if it were improved so that the music only pauses when theres an incoming call, as opposed to stopping altogether.;Usa;Positive;Music    
Was excited to read about this app for Dropbox and to avoid iTunes most hated software on the planet.;Mis;Negative;Music

Would really appreciate any ideas on this.  Really need to put a stake in heart of iTunes   Thanks;Mis;Positive;Music    
Perfect for me I keep LOTS of music in my Dropbox, and this is the best app for playing them, without having to iTunes sync. Great features as well.;Mis;Positive;Music   
Amazing App I love the design and very productive. Just one small problem. Please add a scroll bar at the side to make it easier to find desired songs;Usa;Positive;Music   
I was using Dropbox which I like, except I can't listen to more than one song at a time.  It's fine when I have a 30 min meditation to play, but not when I want to hear 4 meditative pieces in a row.  Jukebox is so easy to transfer files and create a playlist.  Why can't they all be this easy  Thank you  Love the ap;Mis;Positive;Music   
Convenient app for listening to music without using data. Welldesigned and easy to use;Mis;Positive;Music   
I wouldnt reccomend another app but this one;Mis;Neutral;Music

No info if there is a size limit. No contact info. These features will be very useful. Please add;Usa;Positive;Music

No filefolder browser. Pools all audio files into one massive list that you have to scroll through. Doubt it will get updated with functionality considering that it's been almost a year without an update.;Sup,Usa;Negative;Music    
If you were able to play music offline, you wouldn't need to download them into into your phone The idea is to save space, not take. However, I do like the unique interface... and free from ads.;Usa;Positive;Music    
This is awesome because I produce music and it enables me to listen to my songs that I am working on....;Mis;Positive;Music   
Really easy user interface and downloads quickly;Mis;Positive;Music   
At the beginning the app worked completely fine and worked very well but after a while I tried to import more songs into jukebox from Dropbox but it kept crashing. I restated my phone, deleted some songs on the app, and tried to make more space on my phone by deleting other apps but nothing worked. I hope this is fixed or someone tells me how to fix this problem.;Dep;Negative;Music   
I've used other apps like music cloud and cloud music player for this before . This app is a massive improvement since it has no ads and the player is sleek. It's also free for real  Thanks for unlocking my Dropbox library jukebox .;Mis;Positive;Music   
This app does not work with my apple watch. Help. How do I fix the problem?;Sup,Usa;Neutral;Music   
I was excited to be able to hear my baby's heart beat, but it turns out this app will give any object a heart beat as long as the speaker is covered  it is such a waste of money and a huge scam. Do not waste your time or money on these apps, just get a real ultrasound or buy a doppler. It's too good to be true, and now I am disappointed in myself for believing otherwise.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle    
Paid 4.99 for an app that doesn't work.;Dep;Neutral;Lifestyle   
Ever since we downloaded the app we can't stop using it Super exciting during a first time pregnancy ;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Downloaded it to hear the heartbeat of my baby , so I tried to see if I could hear my heartbeat as well and couldn't even hear that... I sure would like to have my 4.99 refunded asap... why charge for something that not going to work properly.;Usa;Positive;Lifestyle    
My wife is 40 weeks pregnant.i thought of buying it to check the baby's heartbeat.the volume is pretty low. So you don't know weather you are in the heart area to record the heartbeat.you keep on moving your microphone to capture the actual sound not knowing weather you are at the right spot to record .the recording had good volume.but not the actual application .in fact it doesn't even record my own heartbeat when I tried..it was my folly to purchase it ..;Usa;Positive;Lifestyle    
We love the app  I downloaded it for her to try and it did indeed work  Just the idea that we can finally save the recording is amazing  ;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
I also played around with it and saw that it was relatively easy to find my own heartbeat too;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
But make sure to listen to the samples so that it's easier to understand what exactly your listening too and what sounds you're looking for..;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle    
Im pretty sure my daughter downloaded it on her phone too now ;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle    
I've been trying to use this app for weeks....still nothing I bought a fetal Doppler and found her heartbeat instantly Don't waste your money Will be deleting this app today;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle

I'm so excited, it's great;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Didn't work at all. I bought this app at 27wks and tried to use this all the way up to 40 wks. It never worked once. You could not hear her heartbeat at all.;Dep,Usa;Neutral;Lifestyle   
Please don't believe what other reviewers say about the app working at 16 Weeks or before. You can hear some noise but it's actually your heart, not baby's . I'll try to get my baby's heartbeat at week 30. If it doesn't work, I won't change this review. The 2 stars is for the design of the app  very nice colors and graphic design.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle    
I gave this app an extra star for trying. I could definitely pick up my own heartbeat;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle    
I love this app. I am so amazed. Tips watch tutorial, lay flat on your bed, make sure it's a quiet room, press the microphone to your lower belly 34 inches below belly button, and be patient I had to try different angles and locations before I could hear the beat well. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it the first time. Remember, it also depends on the baby's position.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
So I contacted the app developers about the app not working properly then when they replied in an email, they sent it with about 5 other people's complaints attached with their emails as well. So now a bunch of people I don't know have access to my email and can spam me anytime they want. ;Dep;Negative;Lifestyle    
Response to the developer of course I deleted the email that contained everyone's emails. However, that doesn't mean they deleted the emails that contained my email address. I'm already getting mail from mailing lists that I know I didn't sign up for so how is that good for me Your bug violated my privacy and now it is too late to fix it. So thanks for nothing.;Dep;Positive;Lifestyle   
Did not work at all. Don't waste your money on this. Should give me a refund.;Dep;Positive;Lifestyle   
Please refund my money for this purchase. This app was giving me a heartbeat before I even put it on my skin. And after trying it a few times with recording or just listening it doesn't even give me a heart rate number.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle    
I was hoping this would be something a bit better. Disappointed;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle    
This is my third kid I'm far enough along and this app is junk. I sat around for 25 minutes looking for a heartbeat, but the white noise and quiet nature of the built in microphone made my endeavor pointless. I think 4.99 for this app is a JOKE. I listened to the sample sounds and followed tutorials nada. Don't waste your money. I want a refund....;Usa;Positive;Lifestyle    
Tried the app many times over the last few weeks, most recently at week 33.  It will capture my heartbeat, but not the baby's.  My doctor mentioned that an iPhone is unable to amplify the sound enough, so I shouldn't expect this app to work evereven nearer due date.  Waste of money;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle   
Says in the app it only works after you're 30 weeks pregnant, I am not 30 weeks yet but I try to test it out with my own heart beat and it doesn't work. Don't waste your money;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle    
First check the review and see if they were using it after 30 weeks. If they weren't the review is invalid. Use logic it says recommended after 30 weeks. At 35.5 we downloaded this and with in a couple minutes found the heartbeat clearly. Also we watched the tutorial built into the app. This very easy to use and has very specific instructions. Great app and very nice to hear our babies heart beat. Follow the instructions and it works.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
I love this app I've never heard of using such a thing and it being accurate the only thing I didn't like was I couldn't really recognize my baby's heart beat let alone my own. Lol But if you know what it's supposed to sound like I guess than you won't be confused like I was Good app though Hopefully this will become very popular Will definitely recommend to all my expectant friends;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle

It really works and I'm 9weeks and 6days and I heard my baby heart beat I was so scared that it wouldn't work I love this app Cute;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle   
They should tell you it's recommended for after 30 weeks before you buy it. There are other items I could have purchased to hear my babys heart beat a lot sooner than that. I know it's an app but I feel tricked, not cool.;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle    
Can't even record the sound. Either fix the problem or I WANT MY MONEY BACK.;Dep;Negative;Lifestyle   
I found my own but since I'm 6 weeks it's harder for me to find the heart beat;Mis;Neutral;Lifestyle    
I've just learned about and downloaded the app at 39 weeks pregnant. It works great and heartbeat is easy to find since baby is so developed. It's a great little tool to use anytime you want to feel a little extra connection to baby and you don't have to wait for your next doctor's appointment.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
I heard nothing but a bunch of noise and static. So disappointed because I was hoping this app would actually worked. It's a scam.;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle   
This is one of the coolest apps ive ran into for a while now It really does work, you do however have to take into consideration that this is your phone and youre not at your doctors office therefore youre not suppposed to be looking out for the same type of sound. At first when i heard the sound i figured this doesnt work.. but i played around with it for a bit and found the sound samples in one of the tabs. Thats when i really understood what sound im looking for .. quickly after that I found both my heartbeat and my babys;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle   
Don't spend any money on it. It does not work.;Dep;Neutral;Lifestyle   
If you're not at least 30 weeks pregnant don't expect to hear a heartbeat, all you're gonna get is static. Save your money.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle    
I've used this app throughout both of my most recent pregnancies. In my first pregnancy it worked later than in my seconds. Theres some white noise, which makes sense for it only being an app. But once you get used to deciphering between the noise and the heartbeat it becomes really exciting. I highly recommend as this is a much easier option than a doppler.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Its a phone and for that it works awesome Im constantly recording and enjoying every second of using the app;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
I bought this for the features that it said it has but it was the worst app I have gotten this far. The sound is not clear. You can never hear a heartbeat. ;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle    
There are lots of devices on line that you can buy that work great but this is not it.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle    
Doesn't work I want a refund. It hears a heartbeat on a couch. Either fix the problem in the app or give me a refund this is a scam;Dep;Negative;Lifestyle

As surprised as I am since I wasnt expecting that much from a simple 5 app... It really does work great.. It was pretty easy to find my own heartbeat and simple enought to find my babys as well.. the babys heartbeat took a few more minutes to find than my own but once i got it it was easy to keep finding it afterwards.. My mom love this the most as my daughter is going to be her first grand daughter and she loved the recordings i kept sending her So Bravo;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
I've been trying since I was 30 weeks, and all I ever get is static. Waste of money, static is all I hear;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle    
I got this app not too long ago and im pretty satisfied with it. Some days its much more difficult to find the heartbeat than others.. but for the most part its relatively easy to find if in a quiet room. Its also a good app in general easy to use and works properly..;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle

Does not work. All static. My wife is 36 weeks along and we have tried several times to listen to our baby's heartbeat with this app. Can't even hear our own heartbeat.;Usa;Neutral;Lifestyle   
I was very skeptical at first.  I found my heart beat right away and after about 2030 minutes of searching, I found my baby's  I'm only 9 weeks GREAT APP and well worth the few dollars.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
I Personally Thought That This App Was Gonna Work And Be Able To Listen To My Baby's Heartbeat And I Hear Absolutely Nothing It's My First Baby First Time Mom And Can't Even Hear His HeartBeat;Mis;Neutral;Lifestyle    
This is the worst app I got it and instantly hated it after I tried it once Worst 5 spent of my life I wish I could get her back;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle    
The overall sound is terrible It barely works when I try to pick up my own heartbeat It sounds like nothing but a whirlwind of static. The quality is so poor and in my opinion this just doesn't work.

Wow. This company should be embarrassed for gauging hopeful, gullible hello, hormonal motherstobe with this piece of junk. I would understand if it was hard to find a fetus' heartbeat but I should be able to find MY OWN. This app was so staticy, it sounded like a train going over the tracks in any position... didn't hear any beats or anything even resembling a rhythm. My dog likes to rip up paper for a dog time... I should've given my 5spot to her at least that would have been amusing. BOO;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle    
I tried to get this to work for a few weeks, from 35 weeks. I even tried going to the same spot the doctor did to find the heartbeat. It was disappointing. ;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle    
I'm 32 weeks pregnant so I'm within the 3040 weeks it says to use it. It doesn't work at all Would like my money back. I tried with 2 separate devices Extremely disappointed.;Dep;Negative;Lifestyle    
I tried using it several times, and even heard a false heartbeat when I was no longer using the app on my stomach;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle

Should have guessed with a 5 Doppler when the ones online are around 50. This wouldn't even pick up on my heart beat  so of course it didn't pick up baby's heartbeat. Garbage.;Usa;Neutral;Lifestyle   
This thing can't even detect my own heartbeat. I am wasting my time and money. Give me refund.;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle   
This app does not work And they will not refund your money Do not waste your time Or money;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle    
Couldn't hear anything before 30 weeks, can't hear anything after 30 weeks  so it's essentially useless. Don't waste your money.;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle   
Skeptical at first but decided to test it on my arm and then my own heart and I could actually get a clear heart beat from myself then moved my phone to where the dr usually finds the baby's beat and there is was be patient and steady . Definitely a nice app to have..;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle

This is a terrible app. Don't waste your money. I'm 31 weeks and still can't hear a heartbeat. I don't know how people who are only 610 weeks pregnant are saying they are hearing a heartbeat. All I can think is that they think they're hearing it but it's just movement sounds in your stomach.;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle    
Tried for two pregnancies couldn't hear anything. Shame on them for monetizing on moms that just want to hear their baby's heart beat;Usa;Positive;Lifestyle

This app is amazing  I am 6weeks and 3 days since we have not gone to our first apt yet I tried this app. Did not take long at all, found the baby's heart beat in pelvic area. I made sure it want mine. Mine is 82, baby's is 132 Took about 15 seconds of holding in one place to get baby's heart beat;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Doesn't work until late pregnancy and doesn't tell that until it's paid for;Mis;Neutral;Lifestyle    
The app actually works great and does what it says well but it could be so much better. Especially for the price. One major feature I'd like to ask for is for the app to tell us the heart rate. If this app could count the beats on its graph from the sound and give us either a real time heart rate monitor or a overall calculation of the heartbeat on a recording. Until then I give this app a fair rating.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
This app has never worked for me. It also charged me an additional 12.00 a month. My phone carrier isn't charging me, the app itself is. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle    
This app is a complete scam It scams exited, naive pregnant women First of all, it does not tell you before hand it works better on the third trimester , it gives you a notices AFTER you buy it. Though angry I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried the app on 36 week pregnant friend, and it did not work either. Better off spending your 5 renting a movie.;Dep;Negative;Lifestyle    
I'm 20 weeks 3 days and I finally heard it  The room has to be super quiet and I gad to breathe really smoothly.  it took me several tries for a few days and moving the phone all around but this morning I heard it for the first time on the app.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Had this app since 30wks.Now I'm 39wks and it's still the same static and noise ;Usa;Neutral;Lifestyle    
Doesn't  pick up heartbeat at all. 37 weeks and totally wasted money. Better apps are out there. Good luck if u chose this app.;Usa;Positive;Lifestyle    
I thought that this was gonna be one of those apps that already have prerecorded baby heart beats that it plays to make you think it's your baby but it's not It took me a while to find my baby's heartbeat and when I did he kicked the microphone and it picked that up too so I knew it was real. Not a waste of money. Just need patience;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle   
Stay away from this app . People who said in a review is a lie this app is fake waste of money . I got this app bcz I read some positive reviews but again this is a lie and fake app. DO NOT BUY IT;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle    
This app does not work I'm 34 weeks and can't even hear my own heartbeat.  Feeling my baby move provides more comfort than this app can.  I put my phone on airplane mode and took off the case.  It still would not pick up anything.;Dep,Usa;Positive;Lifestyle   
Doesn't work. I want my money back.;Dep;Negative;Lifestyle   
Don't buy this app. Seriously. The app tells you that it is most effective during a certain time of your pregnancy, and I am about to bust at the seams and it still doesn't work.;Dep;Positive;Lifestyle   
I have had this app downloaded since I was 20 weeks. I am currently 38 weeks with a healthy 7lb. baby and I have not been able to pick up her heartbeat even once with this app. I use an iPhone 6s with no case, yet it still cannot detect it. Don't bother.;Usa;Positive;Lifestyle

This app does not work. What a waste of 5;Dep;Positive;Lifestyle   
Have not heard any heartbeat and currently 32 weeks. I'll keep giving it a shot but definitely not worth your money. Feeling your baby move is more fascinating than placing your phone only for it to pick up the movements you already feel with your hands.;Usa;Positive;Lifestyle   
This app might be 5.00 but I assure you it is well worth it Thanks to this app, my wife and I will no longer have to wait l to hear the heartbeat at the doctors visits She is currently 14 weeks and we find the heartbeat at least once a day Its such an amazing feeling Best 5 dollars I have ever spent;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Sadly I was fooled by the reviews but it doesn't work, it won't even pick my own heart beat. Very very disappointed;Dep;Negative;Lifestyle   
Don't even bother buying this app, its such a waste of money. I've tried countless times and all I ever get is static and I'm 37 weeks. I can hear my own heartbeat but even then it's not great.;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle   
Don't waste your money. This app is a joke. It doesn't work on yourself, or your baby. All you get is continual static.;Dep;Positive;Lifestyle   
If I could give this 0 stars I would. What a waste of money and time It didn't capture my baby's heart beat, let alone my own I even put it on airplane mode.;Dep;Negative;Lifestyle   
I have tried countless times to hear baby with no success. I've thought maybe it's because I haven't been far enough along but I'm 39 weeks now and still nothing. I can hear my heartbeat just fine, but not baby's. All I get is static with baby. I can hear kicks though, which early on when kicks first started was kind of cool to hear. Also it's been a good tool to use if baby hasn't moved around a lot in the day  when I put my phone on my belly the pressure and the noise really makes baby move around. So perhaps that's the problem To be fair, I complained to the developer and they responded quickly, however they basically gave me the instructions on how to use the app quiet room, find your heartbeat first, try the different mode, etc which I had already been doing. I never pay for apps so this one was a disappointment... and I really was hoping it would work. Next baby I will buy a stethoscope.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
After reading all of the positive reviews, I was excited about this app.  We thought it would be a more affordable option than buying a heart monitor in retail and we wanted to be able to checkin on the baby throughout the pregnancy because we had complications in the past.  Unfortunately, I never once could hear my little ones' heartbeat which was shocking considering we never had issues finding or holding onto a heartbeat in the doctors office. I tried the developer's suggestions to find a quiet room and I also tried to listen at multiple times throughout the day and it never worked.  Even at 39 weeks, I never heard a heartbeat regardless of where I positioned it.  In fact, I had a hard time even capturing my own heartbeat . I gave it two stars because it is easy to use good navigation and userfriendly and offers some good features but since I wasn't able to ever hear a heart beat it was a waste of money.  Since everyone's pregnancy is different, it could just be that I wasn't a good candidate for this type of thing...maybe it would work better for others;Dep;Positive;Lifestyle   
I'm 27 weeks and had no problem hearing her heartbeat or movements Fantastic app for 5;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle   
Doesn't work I'm 37 weeks and can't hear the heartbeat. Don't recommend buying the app;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle   
I love this app At first I was looking into purchasing a Doppler, but then I found this app and decided to try it out before making the purchase. I could hear baby's heartbeat beating away at 8.5 weeks It was a little faint but I could definitely tell that that's what it was. I am now 11 weeks and the heartbeat is much louder and more distinct. When using this app, you do need to be in a quiet place, and it does take a little bit to get used to the difference between the white noise and baby's heartbeat. However, once you find it it's very obvious that it is the heartbeat. Definitely beats the cost of paying for a Doppler and works beautifully. Highly recommend;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle

I saw the ad on a pregnancy site and clicked more to view. It wasn't until I bought the app that it told me that I needed to be 30 weeks pregnant for it to be successful  Really I want my money back.

This app is truly amazing and definitely worth the money Once you're far enough along and you find your baby's heartbeat yourself, you just melt Being able to hear my baby's heartbeat whenever I want and not just when I see the doctors is the best thing ever Wish I had gotten it with my first baby Just remember to give it a few seconds and be in a very quiet room;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Does what it says beautifully...BUT I had the help of a stethoscope to find the best place to place the phone first If you can get on the closest place to the heart, it'll work like a charm from 2930 weeks on. Need phone case totally off. Can't imagine having hunt for beat all over my stomach...I just happen to know where he likes to lie so it's pretty easy plus a stethoscope to confirm We just use it to record, but it does it;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
If I want to hear a magnetic sound completely horrible probably this is the best app ever BUT I never wanted that... so for me is better spent the money in another thing;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
I've been past the recommended 30 weeks, followed the directions exactly, and tried numerous times over the last few months without any success with this application. It was a waste of money.;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle

I hear my heartbeat just fine and I'm 35 weeks now. But I don't hear the baby's heart rate at all. And if I try adjusting it around my belly, I get sounds but the sounds are from my movements or accidentally tapping my phone. Not to mention you have to be in a really quiet space. Maybe you can hear the baby and I'm just mistaking it for something else but it doesn't give me much relief use this app.;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle

I normally don't ever give 1s but this app did not work for me at all. I started trying to hear my babies heartbeat at 15 weeks which wasn't a surprise it didn't work.

Actually worked and I'm only around 78 weeks. You have to be patient with it though. This is my fourth pregnancy and from my own experience, even at the doctors office, the doctor doesn't usually get a good heartbeat immediately, they have to move around a little. You'll have to do the same thing with this app.;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle   
This app is trash please don't waste your money.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle    
This app does not work at all. I've tried it with both my pregnancies. I am 36 weeks now and it doesn't work at all. Waste of time.;Dep;Negative;Lifestyle   
Just heard the little guy at 23.4 weeks. App is simple to use. I like that it has sample tracks to help you learn when you're hearing baby vs mom and to level your expectations about noise interference.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Just like the app says, 30 weeks or more Just wait til the right time and it'll be awesome.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
This app was real fun to play around with while I was pregnant.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Don't bother The sound you think you're hearing is not your baby. I have access to a Doppler in the office and can get the heartbeat no problem and when I try at home with the app so dad can hear it, nothing real, even at 32 weeks And I know I'm using it right because I can get my own heartbeat on my chest easily.;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle   
I absolutely LOVE this app. I am 12 weeks and it works amazing It's so worth it.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle

It sounds like someone playing with a plastic bag into the mic.  I followed the tutorial exactly and I can't decipher the baby's heartbeat.  Waste of 7;Usa;Positive;Lifestyle    
I downloaded this super early in the pregnancy around 9 weeks. I've rarely been able to find my own heartbeat for more than 56 beats. I'm 37 weeks now, and the sounds it's picking up are no different than at 9 weeks. I actually suspect it's playing a sound track and not actually communicating with the mic when it is only picking up faint sounds.;Usa;Positive;Lifestyle   
As long as your cover the mic it detects heartbeat  Fraud;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle    
I'm 22 weeks pregnant, I was really curious so after reading reviews, I decided to give the app a shot. I tried my own heart beat first and right off I found and deciphered it Next I tried baby. I can tell exactly where baby is from all the kicks After about 5 mins of trying I found the heartbeat So cool;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
This app is 7 you would think it could at least calculate the heart rate. This app doesn't even detect the heartbeat let alone rate. It just sounds like a bunch of static. Save your money and buy something for your baby. This app is totally not worth your money or time;Usa;Positive;Lifestyle   
I can get it to hear and play my heart beat, but even with me being 33 weeks I don't pick up anything from the baby. I've tried several times in several different positions and still nothing. I bought it when I was like 12 weeks and tried thought my pregnancy and no luck.;Usa;Positive;Lifestyle   
I tried it twice and I believe it works;Mis;Neutral;Lifestyle   
I'm 17 weeks and I could hear the heartbeat. It took me a while to find, but when I did I was so excited  Patience is the key. The baby was moving around a lot at first .;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle

I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing this app. Very disappointed when it never worked. Tried from 25 weeks to 37 weeks and never got it to work. Even had my nurse try it while we doing an ultrasound. Save your money;Dep;Neutral;Lifestyle    
So at first I was skeptical but who wouldn't be But after paying the 5 and playing around we actually heard the heart beat. I do have a recording of it as well and you can definitely tell that it is the heart beat. We started around 31 weeks and have played around since. 4 stars because it's not perfect of course. Sometimes it's hard to hear or you can't hear but that also has to do with the baby's location. So, for 5 to get to hear the heart there and there isn't even a question. A cup of coffee or smokes or fast food  ability to hear the heart ... Priceless.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
The sound of a heart on this app is so annoying it just sounds like static so save your money for a real Doppler it annoys you because you can't actually hear a heart beat it's a screeching sound;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle   
I'm 32 weeks and I can totally hear my baby's heartbeat It only took about 3 seconds to locate it. SO COOL Best money I've ever spent on an app ;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle

I would first like to say i am well over the 30 weeks and my placenta is not in the way of baby at all. I can find my babys heartrate no problem w dopplar however tried and tried w this app and no luck.. I feel as though it was a waste of money. I would say spend the extra and get a regular dopplar since apparently they are easier..;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle   
I was unsure for a while and did plenty of research before I bought this app. It is worth it. Not only to hear my baby heart beat but to see my family and friends light up when they hear it too. I'm at 21 weeks and I couldn't be happier ;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
I downloaded this early on in my pregnancy and didn't have any luck, but figured this was just because it was too early. Now, at 38 weeks, I still can't hear anything...even when baby has hiccups. Total waste of 5.;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle   
Buy yourself a Fetal Doppler and forget this app. Horrible;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle    
Did not work ever  my daughter at 33 weeks now and still nothing. Dont waste your time or ;Dep;Positive;Lifestyle   
This was the worst app purchase I've ever made. I tried consistently to get it to work and all I got was white noise. I even tried while at the docs office after they did my babies doplar so I would know exactly where she was....nothing Don't get your hopes up.;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle   
I think I started using this around 25 weeks but it was a lifesaver I loved it for the reassurance and used it multiple times a day at the end just to make sure all was well with baby;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Fuzzy but cld hear the beat. Not bad for 5;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle   
I got nervous today, thinking I hadn't felt my baby kick quite as often as I usually do. So I decided to give this app a shot. It took me a good 10 minutes of searching, but I finally heard his heartbeat in the midline about halfway between my belly button and my pubic bone I had to use synthesizer mode to hear him, though I could hear my own heartbeat fine with classic mode. It was worth the effort and patience to reassure me that he is still ticking;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Really  This App doesn't work. I made many tests and nothing.;Dep;Neutral;Lifestyle   
I wish I could give a good review like the ones I had read. I tried to hear the heart beat all the way from 3036 weeks, but I never had any luck. I was super bummed because I was so excited to read others posts about how they heard their baby after 30 weeks etc. I used it how people said to use it as well, and maybe my baby was laying weird to not be able to. Just bummed I  wasted money on it.....;Usa;Positive;Lifestyle   
I can't believe this app doesn't offer something as basic as beats per minute. Without that you really have no idea if you're actually hearing the baby's heartbeat, your own heartbeat, or just static from moving the phone around. I want my money back, I have no reason to ever use this again.;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle    
I have never completed a review online, but this app was so special, I had to I'm only 14 weeks 3rd baby and o was able to hear the baby's heartbeat What a great surprise Made my whole day;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Does not work at all even at 39 weeks I can not believe I wasted money on this app. I would give 0 stars if it allowed.;Dep;Positive;Lifestyle   
This app did not work.  I had it for a couple of days and tried to hear the heartbeat.  Deleted the app after just a couple of days.;Mis;Neutral;Lifestyle    
I tried at week 20 and of course I heard nothing, but at week 30 you most definitely can. I love listening to my babies heartbeat;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
I could hear a beautiful heartbeat very reasurring.. Really thats all that matters;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Those who say this doesn't work are 1 not using it right or 2 their placenta is making it harder to find baby's beat. It doesn't pick up early on, but if you use it as instructed, 30 weeks it works like a charm. Love being able to record my lil ones heart beat. I find it in seconds because I know exactly where his back is. Great app;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Don't waste your money on this app.  All you hear is static. Wish I could actually hear the heartbeat. I'm uninstalling it.;Usa;Positive;Lifestyle   
I was skeptical but as an extremely excited dad i felt this app would be an extra  connection to my baby for me if it worked. We tried early on at week 8 and couldnt get anything. We tried again every few weeks. After week 24 we kind of gave up until week 32. It didnt take 20 seconds and could hear it loud and clear. It was music to my ears. I give the app 5 stars bc it does everything it claims to do. It also says that you get the best results between week 3040, which was true in my case. So i say the app is worth the money cheaper than doplar, but wait till at least week 25 to try.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
I thought I had wasted my money on this because I bought it very early in my pregnancy and used it so many times hoping to hear the heartbeat but it was just too early Today at 31 weeks and 6 days I heard it loud and clear Very cool feeling ;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
Doesn't work. I can't hear my heart or my baby's. I want my money back;Dep,Usa;Positive;Lifestyle   
This app didn't work at all. I couldn't hear my heartbeat let alone the baby's.;Dep,Usa;Negative;Lifestyle   
This app doesn't work at all. Hard to distinguish between any of the sounds. Please fix;Usa;Positive;Lifestyle    
I bought this app to give it a try. I am 36 weeks and 5 days. Baby is head down and obviously isn't moving all over. Just left the doctor and used this right where doctor found the heartbeatI get nothing. I could barely pick up my own heartbeat ;Usa;Neutral;Lifestyle    
I followed all the instructions airplane mode, listened to samples, etc. ;Mis;Neutral;Lifestyle   
What a disappointment for 4.99 Ugh;Mis;Negative;Lifestyle    
I hate it ... this app does not work.;Usa;Negative;Lifestyle   
Im at 28 weeks, and I was able to listen to my babys heart beat You just need to follow the instructions theres a video. I also recommend you to listen to the sample sounds, just so that you would have an idea of what you are looking for. It doesnt sound like the Doppler or your doctors fancy ultrasound, but you can definitely hear your babys heart . I love it;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle   
I have had this app downloaded since I was maybe 15 weeks pregnant. Since my placenta is in the back of my uterus, I have had no issues feeling my sweet baby boy move since 15 weeks or hearing his sweet little heart beat with this since 23 weeks. I am now 30 weeks and I can find his heart beat every day with this. Its very good and Im happy this is free because I didnt want to spend 60 on a doppler. I totally recommend this app to any pregnant woman who wants to hear their sweet bub. I would suggest waiting until around 25 weeks to make sure you can actually can pick up the heart beat, but dont be discouraged if you dont at that point. The app suggests you wait until youre between 30 and 40 weeks and I have had no difficulty finding his heart beat now that I am 30 weeks. Earlier it was a little bit difficult. Make sure you use airplane mode when youre looking for the heart beat though and that youre in a quiet room.;Mis;Positive;Lifestyle
