"I am constantly seeing differences in the information being displayed in one section vs. another section. e.g. UV Index might be 2 in one section and 3 in another area. It's like each section is getting it's forecast from a different source. ","Positive","Weather","Dep"
"I got this app about 2 years ago based on friends using it and it was on point for precip temp. Now however it says it's going to rain on the current day forecast but usually says '0' on the weekly forecast ","Positive","Weather","Dep"
"I have checked out other apps and concluded that AccuWeather is the best in most aspects. I have checked out the accuracy with the other apps and found that all were in agreement. The only thing that makes the temperature inaccurate with all the apps is that I selected Shelton, WA, but they use Olympia which is 16 miles away. Therefore the temperature is a little inaccurate. Overall I am happy with AccuWeather.","Positive","Weather","Dep"
"I love accuweather. Compared to other weather apps this app has been the most reliable and accurate. However the widget has an annoying bug. It has text doubled over other text and the temperature seems not to be updating regularly. But I'm not entirely sure of that because I cannot read it because there is text over the number.","Positive","Weather","Dep,Usa"
"I would also like to know where it is connected to that it is getting readings from. It is no where close to any of the reading in this area that I live in.","Positive","Weather","Dep"
"Its a good app but the widget has some bugs on iPhone 7","Positive","Weather","Dep"
"Minutecast says no precipitation for 120 minutes, but when I look at hourly it says 59 chance of snow in the next hour.  It had chances of snow between 4060 for a four hour period.  It never did snow during that time.","Positive","Weather","Dep"
"Not very accurate in eastern Pa. Will show that it's raining but the description says rain starting in 15 minutes. I believe it relies on it's information from airports so the further away you are from that airport the less reliable it will be","Neutral","Weather","Dep"
"Occasionally the reading for  chance of precipitation and degrees are swapped in error, but quickly switching between them fixes it. ","Negative","Weather","Dep"
"One annoying thing about this app is that no matter what I do it shows me in a city 35 miles south of where I am, with a mile high mountain in the way the weather is very different.","Negative","Weather","Dep"
"Reported 2 years ago that it won't keep my location address. Still not tracking right. It's showing weather for my zip code but several miles away on some street at least 2 miles away.","Neutral","Weather","Dep"
"So if you want a really good looking weather app, this is it. In terms of actually forecasting the weather, the summaries are a bit too sparse.  In terms of general quality, it's below average, because the widget problem should have been caught in development  it's that obvious if you use it for a while. ","Positive","Weather","Usa"
"The AccuWeather app used to be quite accurate, but a year or two ago changes were made which have greatly deteriorated the quality of the forecasts.  Even with a specific address in place the Minutecast shows rain when it is not raining and no rain or coloration on the map when it is.  The temperatures are off by 810 degrees.  The wind speed is accurate only part of the time.  The new app is also less user friendly.  I use the old one to check on the month as a whole but that's about it.  This app serves for a very general picture if the weather... hot, cold, windy .... but it does not reflect actual weather anymore then the NOAA does.  I find that Weather Underground is the most reliable and specific weather app here in Rio Rancho, NM.","Positive","Weather","Dep"
"The app is very accurate but the only thing that bothers me is when there is rain in the forecast. Usually it will say there's a 50 chance of rain, sometimes it can be frustrating when trying to plan a work day outdoors. Besides the the projected future forecast seem to be fairly accurate up to a week or so and it's very helpful.","Positive","Weather","Dep"
"The bad thing is that the daily forecast summary is pretty sparse.  Some might think that this is a good thing. But it can be off.  For example tomorrow's forecast calls for Mostly cloudy with a shower. Problem is that according to all of the local TV news forecasts, what is really going to happen is Passing cold front in the morning, bringing a chance of light sprinkles and or snow flurries in the early morning to late morning. Clearing in the afternoon. ","Positive","Weather","Dep"
"The weather now is rarely accurate. Quite frustrating. Temperature is often wrong. This is unacceptable and needs 2 be fixed immediately","Negative","Weather","Dep"
"This app has constant bugs and misinformation. It will say rain when there is no rain, temps are off, forecast inaccurate. Next","Negative","Weather","Dep"
"This app is useless and the only thing it does is tells lies. Uninstalling","Negative","Weather","Dep"
"I like the app as it gives you everything you need to know except the weather alert statement. All it says is weather alert remains in effect til a certain time but doesn't tell what the statement is.","Positive","Weather","Dep"
"I hate that now the app only allows you to see minute cast I need to be able to see how the rest of the week will be, what will the minmax temperature, will it rain or not.... I have no need for how the weather will be in 10min ","Negative","Weather","Usa"
"Accuweather has been my favorite weather app for the last several years but after the most recent redesign it's gone to the bottom of the list. What's with all the videos in the middle The shaded background is gone and that made it much easier to read. ","Positive","Weather","Usa"
"Additionally, while the UI is clean and organized, it can require a lot of scrolling. I'd prefer an option for a more layered approach that provides more current data at a glance but allows drill down to see forecast details.","Positive","Weather","Usa"
"All the words and images are jumbled together making it unreadable. Change the user interface and organize things on the screen ","Neutral","Weather","Usa"
"Also I'm having the same prob as other reviewers with the widget overlaying the fonts from different temps of the day so it's useless ","Negative","Weather","Usa"
"Been using AccuWeather from the beginning, and it has always been my absolute favorite weather app. Not anymore. They took something simple and beautiful and made it ugly and complicated. Many of the features are so difficult to find, I haven't even been able to find them yet. What's with all the new tapping and swiping AccuWeatheryou really blew it. Horrible update ","Negative","Weather","Usa"
"Clean interface is nice but too hard to get useful information off of.  I just want to know the forecast for the day and still don't know how to get it.  I just use the website. ","Positive","Weather","Usa"

"I hate the new format. It's difficult to navigate and now only displays five days instead of ten days Very disappointed. ","Negative","Weather","Usa"
"I have held on to the older Accuweather app, but I recenty updated.  Big mistake.  The older app had a great, colorful display.  Now the display has 95 white background with tiny, Applelike, fisherprice icons, and almost unreadable font.  I used Accuweather app for years, but I dumped this new piece of trash.  The Weather Channel app is now much better, trying to be informative and easy to read, rather than Accuweather's toohipforitsowngood illegible new format. ","Positive","Weather","Usa"
"I just wanted a 35 day forecast, without having to tap precipitation or real feel or hourly temperature and having to scroll hourly.... ","Neutral","Weather","Usa"
"I like that I now have the ability to reorder or totally not display  information. For instance, I no longer display the allergy information at all as I don't care for how it's displayed graphic is ugly. ","Negative","Weather","Usa"
"I like the 120 minute rain forecast. It helps me plan when to take a walk. The radar feature could use some improvement though ","Positive","Weather","Usa"
"I love everything about this app except the widget. For some reason it doesn't update on the iPhone 7 and when it does update it tries to write over itself. I use the widget quite a bit and it's disappointing considering AccuWeather really is the best weather app for iOS. If the widget is fixed I will be more than happy to give it 5 stars again. ","Positive","Weather","Sup"
"I loved this app's iOS 10 widget, however with the latest update, when the time of day changes into another forecast range e.g. Day into evening for example the widget leaves the previous font active so it shows font on top of font. Totally unusable now. It would have gotten more stars from me if it wasn't for this. It needs to be fixed. A reboot or remove the widget fixes the issue until 12 hrs later and font on top of font is back again.","Positive","Weather","Sup,Usa"
"I really like all the weather related info provided, but on the current IOS, when you add the app to the summarysearch screen the text is illegible. I guess it's providing temps for every day of the week and not just the current temp, and in doing so the numbers overwrite on another.","Positive","Weather","Usa"
"I tried this last update and gave it a month. Colors made it hard to see. ","Negative","Weather","Usa"
"I use to LOVE this app and use it all the time. I made the mistake of updating and the new version is so non user friendly, complicated  frustrating that I am deleting the app from my phone. That's saying a lot because I have over one hundred apps and accuweather was one of my top three most used apps. I'm not happy about this and I never write reviews but I really hope they consider bringing the old format back that was user friendly. ","Positive","Weather","Usa"
"I usually look at the widget which if great for this app except it's broken. The text is overlaid and is unreadable. ","Positive","Weather","Usa"

"Like app a lot Just a very few tweaks to radar such as ease to put into motion but for the most part you got it solid","Positive","Weather","Usa"
"Lots of data, but very difficult to navigate. The UX is sort of crazy. I just want to see tomorrow and after 2 minutes poking around I still can't see tomorrow. WHy does it have to be so nonintuitive ","Negative","Weather","Usa"
"Love the app until the last update. Now script is superimposing on every word. Hopefully it's fixed soon.","Positive","Weather","Usa"
"Most importantly, it's accurate and provides the necessary information. The layout could use some improvement, or maybe I will grow to like it the more I use it.","Positive","Weather","Dep,Usa"
"My only real complaint is that there is WAY too much white space. I like my weather apps compact with every feature including maps viewable with minimum scrolling. I don't like having to go from page to page to access features. ","Negative","Weather","Usa"
"My primary requirement of a weather app is to give me a good forecast, and AccuWeather does that. I don't find this app attractive. I don't like the white backgrounds the minute cast is a gimmick I don't like having to scroll through a bunch of suggested videos to get to to the written forecast I don't like having to hit the  to get to another favorite city. The swiping set up is confusing. Butthe radar is excellent, and the weather forecast is better than anybody else's. So I put up with the bad layout of the app. ","Positive","Weather","Usa"
"Now you have to scroll to see hour by hour forecast.  I loved how they use to have it where you can see the 10 day forecast.  Now I have no use for this and will be deleting from my phone, a once favorite app, sad. ","Positive","Weather","Usa"
"Please bring back the old format of Accuweather for iPad.  The new format is horrible  The old format was SO easy to use. This new format is difficult to navigate and complicate the process of QUICKLY getting the forecast. ","Positive","Weather","Usa"

"Radar is a great feature, sometimes I get lost in the swiping options for different views and information","Positive","Weather","Usa"
"Since latest update the widget feature isn't usable. It has overlapping fonts. If I do a hard reset I can get rid if one set of fonts temporarily but then the overlapping comes back. Very annoying. Please fix this I loved it before and would give it 5 stars","Positive","Weather","Usa"

"I deleted this app when it asked for my contacts, because it thought it had nothing to do with viruses.

I have read some of the comments here and some of the low reviews. If you are wondering if this app is worth using  I can say tell you it works for me. You must follow the installation directions and give the app access to your device for it to work  I bought the full pro protection program for my desktop computer and laptop a year ago and love the program and service.

My Fitbit app has been awesome I haven't had any issues with crashes, and after running around the app a few times, I know exactly where to find what I'm looking for. Bad memory is not the apps problem, it's yours. It is easy on the eyes, very pretty, and provides a lot of information. Maybe this comes with the fact that I have owned several Polars and Garmin fitness trackers and their applications are pretty pointless.

I do appreciate that the app updates inputs food, etc. across all devices. Navigation is also a bit funky. Adding food takes a lot of clicking on the desktop app until I get the appropriate window, perhaps because it's busy looking for the Fitbit that I cannot pair to the desktop. I also had a problem on the iPhone when I was adding my water after midnight. I was on the proper date, the day prior, but what I added went into the current aftermidnight day.

Also, allowing Waze incidents into the Google Map app isn't the best idea. It showed two accidents in my area this morning that didn't exist and of course, I couldn't delete the false alarms.

"Great function and easy to use while creating great photos","Positive","Entertainment","Mis"
"The filters offered within this application are really quite fun. When I choose to post a picture, I find myself applying all of the filters to see which one I like best. Since you have to select each filter individually and wait for the processing, this can be time consuming. There are some hidden features, in the sense that it's not obvious they are there. You can drag you finger left right on the image to change the intensity of the effect. You can swipe down to create a split screen and move it around but it's a little clumsy. Also, if you want to save the image and post it, those are individual steps instead of selecting multiple actions at once. There is one thing I am unhappy about. You can't change the location assigned to a posted image and they use your current location instead of the location the photo was taken. Since I tend to up load photos once I am home, the location information is always incorrect. I would like the ability to apply the filters on my computer. I'm going to try and print some of the images just to see what happens. I really like the idea of this application, but it's not a mature offering yet. ","Positive","Entertainment","Usa"

"This is a must app for me when editing my pictures.","Neutral","Entertainment","Mis"
"The filters are unique and interesting. Unfortunately, it's not uncommon for it to crash when selectingapplying a style. The lag time for processing isn't too bad considering the nature of the filters, but it could be better. Also, it is difficult to adjust the intensity of the effects it's rather haphazard trying to even get it to pull up. Overall, 45 for it's features you can't really customize an effect that I can see and 35 for functionality. It's discouraging to use the app with all it's potential if it keeps crashing. I'd rather the developers improve the features already present and their functionality before introducing anything new. ","Neutral","Entertainment","Per,Usa"

For basic PDF editing, such as writing textsignatures, trimming pages, combining pdfs, drawing, and adding symbols, I would recommend getting Notability for a onetime payment of a couple of dollars.

"I intended to use this version of Acrobat for portable proof reading of documents created on a computer. These are big documents which require frequent revision, and I like to be able to proof read at times I'm away from the computer. Towards that end, I'm using Dropbox, and frequently replacing the file. Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to refresh the file in Acrobat, so I'm totally stuck looking at an old version of this file. I tried deactivating Acrobat so it will reboot, but that still doesn't refresh. As such, this app is completely useless to me and thus gets but a single star rating. It is very rare that I rate an app so low, and it makes me especially unhappy as I'm paying monthly the ridiculously high fees for an Adobe CC subscription ","Negative","Business","Usa"

I access a LOT of excel documents and with the new update I can no longer access the tabs in the excel documents. It's not only frustrating, but makes this app nearly unusable for me since I need to be able to access all the tabs. Heck, is still give it 55 stars even with the bug, but it's very frustrating since that is the main reason I have this app. I hope there is a fix soon ","Positive","Business","Usa"

The Apple Pencil works great, but if I want to change the line thickness, color, or opaqueness, I have to make some marks, then save, then tap my marks to change them.  It's really a hassle.  It would be great to have a menu WHILE I'm making freehand notes, like the sketch and draw apps.  More color options would also be nice.  The standard colors are ok, but I like to use pretty colors when I'm using pens and paper, so it would be nice to have pretty colors when I go paperless, too. ","Positive","Business","Usa"

"The only part of the app that I would say is lacking a little is the editing part. The editing tools are very basic. There is no compatibility with the Apple Pencil. The highlight option only lets you highlight in bright yellow. The draw option does not let you change the line size, or the color.  ","Positive","Business","Sup,Usa"

"This app is good, but there's an annoying side bar that has a mind of its own. If you slide your finger in another active app to flip through a page, Adobe's Acrobat side bar opens up. It would be nice to disable this unnecessary feature, but so far I haven't found a say to do it.","Positive","Business","Usa"
"I have traded emails with Adobe support. The popup side bar can be deactivated by going to the multitasking tab in iOS General tab and turning off Multitasking. When multitasking is turned on, a user can be using an application and do a side swipe that theoretically will show all other apps that function in split screen. If I open Safari and do this, only Acrobat pops up in that list and shows all the documents linked to Acrobat. When I open Acrobat and do a side swipe, several apps show up in that side bar. This leads me to believe the issue isn't Acrobat related, but iOS related. ","Positive","Business","Usa"

Not so much on the app. On the desktop version, security settings allow a PDF various levels of security. When I'm sent documents for school, I'm restricted from changing the content of the document, but I can still highlight and comment to take notes. Not in the app. Even with this lightest level of security, I can't do ANYTHING to the document, which makes it being portable absolutely pointless. Please fix this.","Positive","Business","Sup"
"It is easy to understand but it has a flaw unlike other places where you can go in and edit maybe to delete one of something when u accidentally added more than one.  Overall i would say it's good.

Why the current version removed this, forces me to install an additional scanning app, which requires an Adobe ID which i dont want complete with email advertisments, wow and doesnt even provide the same features identify, click, and save feature now replaced with a horrible automatic scan is beyond me.

"Horrible at syncing Dropbox files not all of my files from Dropbox appears. I try to use this app to help me with my course readings...but its a hit and miss with this thing. It becomes counterintuitive when trying to force stop and restart the app. Secondly, it forgets that my information has been synced, so it asks me multiple times if i would like to include my Dropbox files onto adobe...","Negative","Business","Usa"
"I like this app. I use it for work every day. My whole company does uses it on  iPhones and Android phones. The only problem I have with it is that it needs a better tutorial about how to save and how to type in areas when you have a writable PDF. Before you use this app for work, investigate it, it will take them a while to understand how things work on it and how to navigate the app.","Positive","Business","Usa"

"The previous reviewer indicated that Adobe offered a fix of turning off Multitasking under the general tab.  That would be fine if you definitely don't want any multitasking to show up.  But here's the thingWhile Acrobat is installed, no other apps will show up if you swipe from the right  only Acrobat.  If you are in Acrobat and swipe from the right, you can see the apps that are normally supposed to show up as part of multitasking.  It looks like a nice feature.  The problem is, you can't have that feature and Acrobat too.","Positive","Business","Usa"
"For now I will turn off multitasking because if I delete Acrobat, I lose my documents.  After I take the time to back them up in another app, then I will dump Acrobat until they fix this situation.  ","Negative","Business","Usa"
"The other reviewer decided it was the fault of iOS, but I have to disagree.  At the very least, Acrobat should find a way to turn off their own multitasking within their own app.","Negative","Business","Usa"

I want better scores but that stupid thing gets annoyingly distracting. I really think training the brain is cool but seriously get rid of the check icon andor whatever the game shows on the screen that is not part of the game whenever I get it right. It's like dealing with a stupid happy teacher that compliments every time a student gets something right been thru that lol, and it's not a big deal that I get right each time, I wanna get more right faster so get out of my way lol.","Positive","Education","Usa"
"Another thing I want to mention is that the multitasking train game... I guess it's supposed to test u on prioritizing skill too but if that's the case then it should consider the player's color of preference too, I think. Last but not least, I also want to point out that the game should ask if the tv or loud music is on, what kind of distractions a player may be experiencing before she plays these games every time so that the system is aware of the ability of the player. I did notice that it asked me a couple of times how many hours I slept but it doesn't every time so what's the about I do play the free version so I don't know what the paid version offers but so far I'm not so impressed tho I do enjoy the game more than other free games that I seldom play that probably doesn't train my brain as much as Lumosity games.

And, I really like this one because of a few reasons, but mainly because of the variety of games and the variety of brain areas that it challenges.

When I purchased it through the App Store, it clearly states that it allows Family Share. The description doesn't state that a Family account has to be purchased on Lumosity's website NOT through the App Store. So I purchased the year subscription because the price is significantly cheaper, only to find out later that you can ONLY purchase the family account through Lumosity's website or if you purchased it through the App Atore you have to email them to set it up.

Once I narrow down a selection then I can take the time to go see them. Before that, I am saving tons of time by scouting online first. Sellers don't have to show to someone who really isn't interested, and buyers don't waste their time seeing homes that do not match their description.

I see some that say potential listing What the hell is that It's either for sale or it's not. Glad it was free and even at that price it's not worth it. Someone should also update the overhead view options. I look at houses on my block and some of the pictures are over 5 years old.

If we spoke a second language perfectly we wouldn't be using the app or needing to pause for a second to think of the word.  An easy fix which many would find very valuable.

And when it comes to the raid system, I dislike that you have to use a pass to join a raid, not knowing that there aren't other users, a preview of how many other users joined should be shown. And as for joining a raid, for example if I join a raid for a specific Pokmon, then the gamer should be placed in a lobby system, waiting to be matched with users trying to attack the specific Pokmon as well, no matter what state or country the gamers are playing at...

As the raid bosses are sometimes extremely difficult to beat without a large party size, could you add a feature that allows players to request help on a raid battle Something that would pop up over an active raid battle that tells you there are other trainers nearby waiting to take on the raid boss but need help. This could aid in bringing people together if trainers don't have a large group of friends who also play the game. Thanks, and keep up the good work ","Positive","Games","Usa"

"Gym coins are horrible you should get more than 50 a day. If you have a crap load of gyms taken over, and you worked hard you deserve to get all the coins for the time they are in. So once they come back you should get the 50 for that hour, and if it's been two days then a limit should be per Pokmon. So say one Pokmon is in a gym, that Pokmon should be limited to so much a day once it's returned, but it there shouldn't be a limit on all per day. You should be able to get 50 per Pokmon in each gym a day. So for ex. If I have 3 Pokmon in a gym for one hour it's 150 coins, so if 1 Pokmon is in a gym for a whole day the max coins should be like 50 to 100 per Pokmon so we aren't losing our effort, and time on gyms.

"It's been a year since my first review and it's still impossible to track Pokemon within the game. Worse yet, garbage Pokemon still hold priority on the nearby list. I was two feet away from a Snorlax the other day and fortunately I stumbled onto it because the only Pokemon on my nearby were Spinarak and Pidgey. I'm not even in a super rural area, so I can't imagine how awful it still is for players out in the country. Since raids were introduced, my app has crashed literally hundreds of times over a 23 week span, so Ill update this review yet again when I can assess how this recent patch fixes crashes on iPhone 6. Obviously the game is enjoyable considering I've been playing since launch, but it's disappointing to look back and see that in all that time Niantic still hasn't fixed a number of obvious flaws within the game. I would love to see a The Pokemon Company buy out, but consider how much money Niantic is raking in, I don't think that's likely any time soon. ","Neutral","Games","Dep,Usa"

For 1 it would be a good idea so when you click on a raid you could see how many people were there BEFORE you put in a raid pass. For 2 it would be a good idea to nerf legendary raids so they are easier to defeat because me and 10 people  all above level 27 went against an articuno and we could not defeat it, it always ended up ending up in the red. Plus I have heard of some people defeating a raid and losing anyway because they defeated it at the end of the timer and it takes to long for the raid Pokmon to shrink. So either ditch the shrinking animation or having the timer STOP when defeating it. I hope you read this and I hope you have a nice day person reading this now I shall be gone.

"Pokmon go, is an awesome game, but apparently Niantic isn't very concerned about how many people play their game because of the recent updates. All this began when the time for Pokmon to spawn was changed from 5 to 10. Not a big deal, it was still fun and promoted walking. Then, there was a small grace period before they released their second fatal  update. They scrapped their tracking system. SERIOUSLY THEY REMOVED THE ONLY WAY TO FIND POKMON ACCURATELY That also removed all third party scanners, which literally was the only reason most of the players actually went to catch Pokmon. But more advanced trackers like FPM survived. Then they killed any form of hope by adding a captcha robot detector feature. Which removed all the advanced third party scanners. Being able to actually know where the Pokmon I wanted to catch were was the only reason I played Pokmon go. But I still played for a while by riding my bike and running certain trails. But then, the final straw was when Pokmon ceased to appear if you walked, ran or biked too fast. Now, all I can do in Pokmon go is walk around at the speed of Old man to catch a pidgey or two. Or if I'm lucky, a rare and elusive rattata. That's how much I care at this point. Pokmon go lost like 90 of its players because of Niantic's wrong decisions. Also, seriously, the buddy system is is complete and total garbage. Let me walk 5km to get 1 candy for my eevee And don't forget about Pokmon go's high end nearby tracking system. Which is completely broken. There was a koffing on the last slot which means it was the farthest away and suddenly it appears right in front of me. All in all, I don't think Niantic even cares about this game anymore. They removed key features and made the game unplayable. ","Positive","Games","Sup,Usa"

Now I get that by feeding Pokmon berries.  How many do you say  250 Pokmon.  I have to feed 250 Pokmon a day to get that same bonus.  Or catch 100 Pokmon.  Who has time to do the work to do that ","Positive","Games","Usa"
"I have been playing Pokmon Go since release, me while I am a huge fan, I need Niantic to get their act together and help out us rural players. I am going to list out all of the things wrong with rural playing, and give pointers on how to fix. ","Positive","Games","Usa"
"First of all, spawns are an absolute joke out in rural areas. Since then you have increased spawn rates, however all that has accomplished is increase the amount of crappy Pokmon that I come across. Please Niantic, increase RARER spawns, because even a rock or fire Pokmon gets me excited at this point. ","Positive","Games","Mis"
"Second of all, while the new gym system is MUCH improved from the older system, it still has its flaws. The first is the 50 coin max, as the limited gyms in these areas are always changing hands. That way, is you hold a gym for longer it's really an accomplishment OUT in rural areas, yet no real reward is given. The other thing that needs to be changed is less about rural areas, but if more then one Pokmon get knocked out in the same day, only the first rewards coins. This feature is absolutely ABSURD considering we still worked to get those other gyms, yet get no reward.  ","Positive","Games","Mis"
"The third feature that needs changing is raids. I love the feature, as it has already helped me to get several new Pokmon. HOWEVER, in rural areas, good raids are far and few between. So when I find something like a Snorlax or Tyranitar raid I get really excited. That's all well in good, except for the fact that their cp is too high to beat without any other players nearby, remember that rural thing so I have never beaten ANY OF THEM Still don't have A Tyranitar ","Positive","Games","Mis"
"The fourth is being led into by my third, and that is the new legendary raids. Legendaries have been hyped up ever since the game came out, and not only am I sorely disappointed but I will never get one. Again, good raids are far and few between, so finding a legendary raid is hard enough. Then I can never beat one because there are no players that play near me to help with the raid. And say that for some reason I actually do complete a raid which I won't then the catch rate is THREE PERCENT To make it fairer, I think they should do two things. One of which is a suggestion and the other is something that absolutely needs to happen. I think a good idea would be that the legendary raid cp should not be a determined thing, and should be created by the amount of people who are in the actual raid. That way it would still be really hard, but not impossible for rural players to complete. The other thing that needs to be implemented is the increasing catch rate of legendaries to at least 15 considering beating them is hard enough. Maybe they could also have an event where all of the already released legendaries are put in raids and their cp cut in half if they don't do the auto scaling cp. ","Positive","Games","Mis"
"Again, I love the game but they need to better scale it towards rural players just as much people in the cities. Please recomment any of my suggestions that you find fitting so Niantic can see ","Positive","Games","Mis"

"Pokmon Go is notorious for its overabundance of Pidgeys, Ratattas, Weedles, Venonats, Sentrets, and Spinaraks.  The game alerts players as to which types of Pokmon can be found in the wild at a given time and place, some of which are such rare spawns you hardly get to find them anywhere else.  Every single time, I'm let down by the Nearby list because my radar is flooded with these overabundant Pokmon I've listed above instead of the spawns the list had promised. ","Negative","Games","Usa"
"The only way to make progress in Pokmon Go is to catch several, sometimes hundreds, of duplicates of the same species of Pokmon to gain Candies, Stardust, and EXP.  But if all but 10 species are readily accessible to catch in the wild, there's no ability for users to catch different species andor make them stronger. ","Positive","Games","Mis"
"I propose that the Pokmon on the Nearby list should spawn in the wild predictably and promisingly.  I cannot count how many times the silhouette of a somewhat rare Pokmon has appeared on the list and have been lost to the abyss that is random spawning.  Please make this happen, Niantic.  Us in the suburbs cannot walk casually from interesting place to interesting place as you could in the city. ","Positive","Games","Usa"

"I appreciate the effort that has gone into this game but at the same time it still needs to be better. the game has decent stability over all but i still find my device crashing often. the pokestop speed lock is absolutely rediculous. riding a bicycle in a pokemon game was half the game and your speed lock is so low it effects my bike. fix that. There probably should also be a daily rewards page not some dumb temporary pop up. last but not least after the pokemon fest failure i would think the devs are gonna actually take the time to figure out if the game is even gonna work instead of focusing on a quick buck i swear the only link that works perfect is the poke coin special boxes lol. pvp and trading needs to be added to this game immediately or your gonna lose a huge player base. trust me i know. your legendary raids have been a headache and people want something that will be an enjoyment. player vs player battles. please stop putting this off and ill give better review.

"It's an amazing game but I want to see other people on my map and be able to request to battle them like friends or random people. Also I want to be able to trade Pokmon with my friends.

I've tried to overlook everything and I must say I've truly TRIED but this last hiccup was my last.

" In raid battles, once the group has come together to defeat a legendary, why don't you give the trainers a higher percentage on catching them It doesn't even have to be 100, at least 6080  is good enough. It's already difficult gathering a team and fighting a tough boss, but why is the outcome which should be the reward for the hard effort so much more difficult The trainer loses the legendary and all the effort has gone to waste. Please do something about this, I believe this would be a great improvement for this game, and many others would believe the same too. ","Positive","Games","Mis"
"I've recently been playing the game but the new update for the gyms is very glitchy. I've put in 7 Pokmon into a gym over the past day and I've only gotten coins for two of them. I would get the notification saying the Pokmon has Returned but I wouldn't get the coins. I've made over 200 coins but have only revived 30 of them. I've also noticed that the legendary Pokmon are not able to be put in gyms which I think it is ridiculous.","Negative","Games","Dep"
"I love some of the changes the folks at niantic have made to the game. Raid battles, gym play, and look forward to some of the things they have in store. One change I'd like to see is get rid of the 50 coin limit per day. I like that you now earn more cions for being in a gym the longer you are there however, it is very discouraging to have pokemon after pokemon return home with nothing to show. Sometimes they will return just before midnight and leave me with no one left to guard.

"Experienced player  level 35 Do not play this game  seriously. It used to be decently fun before the most recent update and now it is just a money grab. The new update has destroyed the competition and reward that the game used to have, it still has concerning bugs that can cause you to waste money, and the developers seem to only care about how much money they can extract from us. I wrote to Niantic to tell them I'd like a refund after a bug that resulted in me wasting my money  of course I get no response. This game is a complete waste of time and money and I urge you to take my word for it. It is a failing game and unfortunately I don't see it being fixed anytime soon.

"As we entered PoGO, the system was janky, but wonderful Niantic stripped basic features and promised improvements in the future. The tracker used to list every pokemon within a 300yard radius. It was fantastic. Before that, it was EVEN BETTER. There were these little steps that told you how close you were to a pokemon. But then Niantic stripped all these features in leu of showing one pokemon that might be near a certain pokestop. And around when they implemented that they also added promoted pokestops at stores like sprint and starbucks. To top it off Trading and person versus person battles were promised at onset and never introduced.  ","Positive","Games","Mis"

Then there was the 3step glitch that took literally 6 months to fix, and all the features like trading and PvP that are STILL not in the game. And on top of that, it is probably a spying tool.

Game crashes consistently and has been doing so since the launch. Now the PoGo Plus has a bug that makes it next to impossible to use it unless you are standing still with your fingers crossed.

There are so many different brushes you can create your own too and its design makes it simple to use and figure out The only complaint I have is that every once in a while, it crashes, but closing out of it and opening it again fixes the problem. I also don't think there are shape options, so you can't make an easy circle for backgrounds, or maybe I'm just too stupid to figure it out. Anyways, I've downloaded many drawing apps and this one is by far my favorite Awesome layout, amazing brush and canvas options, and it comes with tutorials and premade color palettes. You can also create your own color palettes and the options are endless. 1010","Positive","Entertainment","Dep"

"I have been waiting, not so patiently, for the Apple to produce hardware that matches the creative function of Procreate the new 10.5 Pro and Pencil combined with Procreate gives me the ability to draw as I would in my Molskin using a mechanical pencil. And then merge into a digital format Large pixel size allows seamless integration interface with Photoshop. Because my work is both digital and print I have tremndous latitude for creation  any where I want  most recently at 35,000 feet over the Grand Canyon. As a professor my students know and witness the importance of staying current and Procreate is up to producing high quality design work. Other apps are behind, in terms of intuitive use, features and exporting possibilities. Bravo","Positive","Entertainment","Mis"
"Handsdown the best app for the Apple Pencil and iPad Pro. It can seem intimidating at first, but there are plenty of online resources to help you learn, and once you have a basic understanding of how to use it, you'll start creating amazing artwork. Plus, there's always another fantastic feature to discover. If you have an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil, Procreate is a mustdownload app.","Positive","Entertainment","Mis"
"I get that the developers of this app position it mostly as a drawing app, however, some useful tools like text tool, or just rectangle, just some standard things that almost every drawing app has by now are missing here. And seems like they are nowhere to be find in the near future, which is a bit frustrating. ","Positive","Entertainment","Mis"
"This app is virtually flawless  and the only thing keeping it from being my go to drawing tool is the lack of additional technical tools. Give me a ruler, give me an ellipse guide, give me a rectangle tool. This is the one area that apps such as Sketchbook Pro really shine  it has great art tools, and great tools that support the art tools. Procreate has exceptional art tools, but lacks any additional tools to support those art tools  and in my opinion, this is what causes Procreate to fall a bit short. The addition of the new draw assist tool in SBP was a total game changer  being able to ink panels on the fly and illustrate flawless ellipses, lines, squares, etc has made that app PERFECT for both rapid concepting and professional production level art. Procreate will dominate once it has a broader toolset than just customizable brushes. ","Positive","Entertainment","Mis"
"The brushes are very customizable, and this app has a professional feel. However, I feel as if this app is best for people trying to draw traditionalesque painting, not comics or similar styles. There are lineart tools, but what would make this app more accommodating would be features like clipping layers, alpha lock, a paint bucket tool, and a selection layer where you can draw on selection instead of just using the lasso tool. I haven't explored this app completely but I'm pretty sure it doesn't have those tools. Other than that, it's perfect for sketching and painting  as the app advertises.

"I am new to drawing, taking my first lessons. I used Linea for the first 2 weeks, and I still love it for it's simplicity, with just enough options to make it a very fun and useful sketch app. Yet, I soon yearned for more options, and downloaded Procreate. At first, I missed the great simple options and controls of Linea, but by day 2 the power and beauty yes,  well functioning apps are a thing of beauty to me came through and I only use Procreate now.  While I am practicing beginning methods of sketching, I am also learning Procreate, which in itself offers many AHA moments when I learn how to do something I initially could not figure out. ","Positive","Entertainment","Mis"
"With that said, if you are reading this and thinking of buying Procreate, do not hesitate... this app is simply amazing... even for the beginner Part of the joy is the terrific online support and forums. I have not had a question I could not readily find an answer to by searching the web.

"SelectionLasso Tool  The Lasso Tool the tool with the S for an icon is useful in coloring in my opinion. However, freehand selection is often risky since you have to continue along. It would be nice to have a magnetic lasso tool like in Adobe Photoshop CC for people with unsteady hands like myself to use. Also a Select Pen should be added, like the one present in Medibang Paint, it would really help in coloring finer details since Automatic Selections tend to leave a few pixels, leaving the user to have to fill it in manually.

I wish there was some way to just make a new layer, pick a color and a brush, color the spots that you want to be shaded, and then do something to make the spots where you put down the color shaded.

"Since getting an iPad Pro I've used Procreate extensively for a filmrelated project and it's been an unadulterated joy all the way. It's provided the missing piece to my digital art efforts simply by allowing me to draw and paint digitally with a minimum of fuss and associated technology. One stylus, one iPad, one happyasheck artist I love this application and the friendly, attentive, and responsive team behind it. I'd give it six stars if I could.","Positive","Entertainment","Mis"

In other words, I can get effects that I dont even know I want, or knew existed, but when they are right there in front of me, Im happily blown away. Procreate is really a program to commit to, and a pleasure, because in a cold digital world, its something to love.","Positive","Entertainment","Mis"
"This is a great app honestly For anyone who is an artist and wants a good program to use BUY THIS. It has almost all of the features of photoshop and you can have unlimited layers which makes it feel even more profession and worth your money. You can import your own pictures and even import more into the already opened file if you need a reference photo But with that being said, sometimes my app freezes randomly for a few seconds but Ive read about the internet and that could also be IOS 11 doing that so hopefully their most resent unpatriotic helps with that","Positive","Entertainment","Per"

"I really loved the game , but once you finish the worlds theres not much more to do and the toad rallys are gen pointless. Add more worlds Then the 10 would be well spent","Positive","Games","Mis"
"The game is really good, great graphics, controls, smooth. The biggest problem I have is that I spent 10 for a app I beat in 3 days. There's no actual goal after the cake. Maybe a statue. Characters are all fairly easy to get. The levels are good I like the idea that each level changes depending on what color coins your going for. The game overall is just very short. First day of playing I reached max level for the castle that's seriously underwhelming.","Positive","Games","Mis"
"For people who bought the game, could you make level maker Because after you complete the tour, there's nothing else, plus 10 dollars is no joke. I'm not talking like major features like changing how it looks or anything, just a nice simple editor ","Positive","Games","Mis"
"I like this game. Mario is a personal favorite character of mine for 10 years, but this game almost made me stop playing Mario games forever. I hate that you have to pay 9.99 for the rest of the levels. I mean come on I should have expected this because every free to play game has you pay for stuff. I know Family Guy The Quest for Stuff makes you pay for stuff. Now because of that problem, I deleted it and I'll get it back unless you change it. ","Negative","Games","Mis"

"It's an incredible game reminds you of Mario 64, until you reach the second world. Normally games that are free still make money because making a purchase will get you further ahead than those who play for free. This game plays the exact same way until you beat Bowser in the first world, and get told the only way to continue playing is to purchase it for 9.99. After that, a must play turns into a must delete. ","Positive","Games","Mis"
"The app at first draws you in, however, once you get going you realize the rest of the maps are 9.99 and is a complete rip off. It took me an half an hour to complete half the maps only to realize the other half wasn't free. And now I'm basically finding myself bored of the one thing I can do in the game, because I'm isolated to it without spending money. ","Negative","Games","Mis"

"An amazing foray into the world of mobile gaming for Mario. It's a simple game with a one time payment to open all its features. I was hesitant, but now that I've purchased it I'm delighted and surprised with how much fun I have every time I hop into this app. It's easy if you want it to be, challenging if you want it to be, and 100 quality Nintendo fun.

"This game is awesome but y do people vote it 1 star I looked at most of the 1 star reviews and most say they like the game but why I think it's because they don't want to pay 10 dollars for the game but the truth is it's almost as good as new super Mario bros U and that game costs 60 And no one complains about that Smr is an under rated game","Positive","Games","Mis"

Now first things first 10 is CHEAP, SOOOOOOO many people complain, its really not that bad lets see, oh Mario Run is 10 so what, almost EVERYONE has a phone or a iPod but not everyone can afford a 300 dollar Nintendo switch and a 60 game. So 10 for a full fledged game is Cheap. Ok, 2 My only Request is to have playing the tour NOT RALLY be Wifi Free. That's it Thanks Nintendo  ","Positive","Games","Mis"

When you join one, you join everybody else and then wait for other people. But you can also say you need to have like 1,000 toads to join. However you can have up to 250 less toads then needed the 8 players battle in toad rallies. And the Winner wins like purple and yellow toads","Positive","Games","Mis"

Anyways,. The idea to do this was really cool except for on thing......if you really wanna play the whole game, your gonna need a ten in you wallet that's available. This is I think the only problem people have had with this game but the game will become more popular if you just end up making the full game like 0.99 at the purchase of the game. Otherwise, this game is awesome.","Positive","Games","Mis"

If Nintendo could do this then they should lower the price down to maybe 4.99 5 then yes I would definitely buy the full version of the game.

It just counters itself in every way with its features. It's not that good. There are a lot of people saying ignore the hate, but I am just saying what I think. Super Mario Run is a bland game, not worth 10. If this game wasn't Mario, it would be less than 2 or even free. Unpopular opinion, but I just don't like it.","Positive","Games","Usa"

You can play the whole game without paying a dime, but on the side, there is a optional feature where you can buy gems or coins. Or, maybe decide for no coins in the game, like slither.io.

"Probably worth more than one star given all the work and promoting put into it but if there's any app out there of which it's total purpose is so obviously set up to generate cold hard cash for the developers, this is it So, yeah yeah, we all know why developers create the applications we use in this wonderful capitalistic society of ours, but to not even pretend that the apps number one purpose might be for entertainment purposes goes against recent app dev norms  Once in the app I found it difficult to begin to enjoy the app. The obvious traps designed solely to introduce you to how the developers plan to separate you from your hard earned cash are unavoidable. I think the first few times I opened the app long ago there may have been a hint of game play, but now I don't see it. The message is clear pay or leave. Thanks anyway, bye.

It looked incredible but once it came out I got it day one I pretty much just started drifting from it and stopped playing it. I'm just being honest. The graphics and visuals are incredible and well done, but how the game plays is just meh. I found myself very irritated playing it. I agree with other reviews on this, but not being able to move back is rage inducing. If anything kept me playing at all, it was the additional characters. But that was not pulling me in enough to keep me playing. Overall, the graphics are incredible but just how the game was designed to play was just a bad idea. ","Positive","Games","Usa"

If you are going to make an endless runner MARIO game, the controls MUST be impeccable to compensate for the lack of freedom that regular Mario games offer.

I've gotten an hour or two of play time just from collecting every coin on the first 3 levels which by the way are absolutely free and offer you a chance to see what's in store before you pay The game is incredibly smooth and well polished and may even convince me to drop the 10 needed to unlock all the other levels 55","Positive","Games","Mis"

"I have collected every item and every coin and have enjoyed every second of it. The game is more than just tapping the screen, there is actual strategy involved. The great thing about the game is that it has challenges for all skill levels, just like most MARIO games do. The beginner will not be turned off while the hardcore player will enjoy the challenges associated with collecting all the coins, Toads, items and playing Rally Mode against tougher competitors.","Positive","Games","Mis"
"You can't beat what you get for 10. Most of us gamers will go out and pay at least 60 for a new game and not give it a second thought, but the moment they charge 10 for an app everyone is up in arms. Pay the price and give it a chance There's a lot more to this game than what you see at first glance","Positive","Games","Mis"
"Now, the biggest flaw that I have found thus far. When you max out your Toads it will make it extremely difficult to collect more Toads of a certain color. If you are like me, you have collected everything but the 2500 Toads required to obtain the classic Luigi statue. Every time you win a rally it will appear you have been given the appropriate amount of Toads, but check again. I usually only get about half of the color Toad it says I got when I win a rally while I'm maxed out. This made it very difficult to get the 2500 green toads I needed. I was finally able to achieve it by losing a few rallies on purpose that didn't require betting any green Toads, but it took way longer than it should have. Nintendo, please fix this bug, or please remove the Toad limit ","Positive","Games","Usa"
"Overall, it's a fantastic game I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the annoying maxed out Toad bug. Maybe Nintendo will fix that and I will change my review. Until then it's a solid 4 star game and worth the price","Positive","Games","Usa"

"The game still requires an internet connection to play  Give me a break  If I pay 10 for a game, it should be playable where and when I want to play, regardless of whether or not I have access to the internet.  I get that Nintendo wants to protect itself from piracy, but this is simply too restrictive.  This really is a deal breaker Nintendo  I won't pay 10 for a game with such restrictions  no other nonInternetbased game I've ever purchased for my iPhone has required a connection to play.

The company reached back out to me to help troubleshoot the root problem and showing a developer that had pride in their creations, wanting to give all who paid for the app to get a functional tool that their name was attached to. I understand an overhaul that was needed, and seen after downloading and playing with the new replacement app, that an update was not as cost effective to cover all the work that was put in to accommodate apples evergrowing feature hurdles, but in stronger in app tools as well as a more for now that is seamless user interface and response time to the selected tool this one had a few hiccups in how fast it applied and following path... but nothing that could upset be adapted quickly in use  ","Positive","PhotosVideos","Mis"

Two wishes I have one is to be able to saverecall masks. If you want the main subject and the background processed differently, you have to select the subject and do your stuff, then commit those changes and go through the making process again but inverted to change the rest. I also wish there was an option to have the mask shown as a particular color so you can easily see what is and isn't part of the mask. Overall, though, this was WELL worth the money.","Positive","PhotosVideos","Usa"
"Good application, but... File export controls need improvement, notably a maximum JPEG output at 100 vs 95. The additional point is to retain original file size and avoid typical IOS and app compression andor loss.

This is also my first time paying real money for an image editor app so I'm extremely pleased to discover it's money well spent. All I needed was a brush and a patch tool to get started on improving some phone wallpapers. I downloaded 10 free editing apps just looking for a simple brush tool. Never found it. This app had both plus more filtersimagecanvas options than I'll probably ever need. The gui is really easy to use.

My only reason for not giving it 5 is the lack of ability to customize the share bar. I share my pics on Tumblr. But that's not one of the default options. Nor is it possible to add it to bar. So instead I have to go through a few extra steps for each photo. I would also like the ability to reorganize the share options to match my preferences","Positive","PhotosVideos","Usa"

"Every time I try to log in after being automatically logged out for some reason the app will not let me log back in. Every time I try it says authentication error try logging in again and I do and it says the same thing. For an app I had to pay for this is extremely disappointing. Also the fact that this is the ONLY way I receive my schedule, I'm kinda screwed. If there was a way to make it 0 stars I would.","Negative","Business","Dep"
"Every few updates this app stops working in not letting you log in. With the recent update I started getting errors and was unable to connect, logged out to log back in to see if that would help but now I'm stuck at the login page.

"The app runs fine on my iPhone 7 Plus. It would be nice if there weren't any load times when opening different shifts to see who's working. Also, add an earnings statement tab","Positive","Business","Per"

"The HS update is awful On the off chance it actually loads, the app is slow and unresponsive. Messages don't even load. You can see the subject line and nothing else. How inconvenient is that when you need to get shifts covered and read important work messages. This app continues to be the worst app I've ever used. Especially because I need to use it daily for work. Please fix. Immediately. We paid good money for this.","Positive","Business","Per,Usa"
"So it worked great... till it didn't. I tried to use the app to check on my work schedule and found out I was logged out. That was about 5 weeks ago and I haven't been able to log back into my account. I have reset my password about 57 times with no luck and when I call customer service I'm told that there's a problem with the app something I already knew told to fallow several steps to fix the issue steps that didn't do much of anything and after that didn't work told there was nothing they could do it's a BAD APP to call apple for help. Yes I liked the app when it worked and would have given it a five if it still was but it's not so it gets a one and if I could give it a negative review I would.","Negative","Business","Dep"

"I paid for the app just a couple of years ago  had the same email  phone number then as I do now so I am confused why I was charged again. That's why I am giving it 1 star if give zero if I could. I've never had any other app I purchased charge me twice. ","Negative","Business","Dep"

"I have tried multiple times to log in and I am 100 sure I have the correct email address and password because I log in to my HotSchedules account on the computer every day to check my schedule and no matter what I do or how many times I change my password or check to see if it is correct it will not let me log in. I am extremely frustrated because I paid money for this app and it's extremely inconvenient to have to go to safari or on my computer to check my work schedule. I'm fairly irritated by this and I have tried everything. I've installed and uninstalled the app and repeated this at least 6 times to see if that would help my situation and it hasn't helped at all. I'm frustrated and so far it's been a waste of time.","Negative","Business","Dep"
"Still says authentication failure invalid username or password when both password and user name are correct I can sign on to the website but not this app.","Negative","Business","Dep"
"I was hoping since everyone I know uses this app for work. You would be able to see how many hours you are scheduled, how many hours you actually worked, and your clock inout times. But since it doesn't it was kinda a let down. ","Positive","Business","Usa"

"I can't log in anymore. What a waste of money. Seriously? ","Negative","Business","Dep"
"The message I get when I try to log in. So far really fun that these updates seem to get rolled out around the weekend which is usually a busy time for those that use hotschedules. Just a thought but maybe a little more rigorous testing for new updates even if it's just minor improvements and maybe picking a Tuesday to roll these things out. ","Positive","Business","Mis"
"Did the update and now I can't even log in, says it can not authenticate the user. But when I login via the website it works just fine. Why pay money for convenience if you can't even get the darn app to work ","Positive","Business","Dep"
"For having paid for an app such as this I'd expect less bugs and more in app features. Being that the HotSchedules application is also a website for multiple businesses, this app should be able to make it much easier but it is in fact a larger headache than just logging in online. It forgets my password majority of the time and when I plug my proper password in it will pose an error. Becoming highly unhappy with this app. Stop the enhancements and focus on the bugs.","Negative","Business","Usa"

"Was the point of this update to slow everything down to the point that it's unusable If so, great job ","Positive","Business","Per"

"Love this app, but since the update, I'm not getting any notifications. One of the number one reasons I use this app. Please fix ASAP","Positive","Business","Dep"
"The best employee schedule app ever","Positive","Business","Mis"
"I had to get this app for work when we switched from Schedule fly. While schedule fly doesn't have an app, it can be set up to send a text when a shift becomes available for pickup, and it sends texts if any message is received. In hotschedules there's no option to get app notifications or texts that a shift has been put up, the only way you can find out is to constantly open  check the app calendar. This is a huge drawback to this app for workers that like to pick up shifts. Hot schedules also only sends a text if a message from a manager is received. It does do a badge alert for coworkers messages, but it would be nice to have an option of text notifications too. Hope these options are considered for the next update ","Positive","Business","Mis"
"Junk. Can use only on sole employee sites. It needs to work on all sites. Please make it work on all sites.","Positive","Business","Usa"
"Until this last update everything WAS working pretty well. Every time I try to approve time off or availability changes the app crashes Please fix ASAP","Positive","Business","Dep"
"Very easy to use and great app overall. No crashing problems, always works and lets me know when I work. I like the sync to calendar feature but sometimes it adds it multiple times to the day. Overall nothing to complain about. I love how easy it is to view and change shifts, get ahold of coworkers and send messages through the app itself. 1010 would recommend","Positive","Business","Mis"
"Cannot request specific days off. When you move to a different restaurant you have to create a whole new user name.  ","Positive","Business","Mis"
"Would not use this app at all. Have the restaurant print out your schedule. ","Neutral","Business","Mis"
"This app is really convenient for jobs and employees. One thing that would make it better is if everytime your schedule is posted, it showed how many hours you are scheduled for the week. Much more easy than me counting them up lol. Other than that, I love it","Positive","Business","Mis"
"Yet another update and the app still doesn't work. It's been 7 months now and I've left a negative review everytime hoping that you would read it and try and do something about it. Apparently not. This is a joke.","Negative","Business","Dep"

"A great app for checking schedules, only problem I have is my phone language is in Japanese and since switching, the app closes every time I try to ask off. Switching back to English fixes it, but I don't want to keep it in English anymore.","Positive","Business","Dep"

"Since the app updated, I cannot edit any time requests I have made.  When I click Time off  Requests and then click edit in the top right corner the app does not allow me to even click an option.  Also if I click the request shown and then click the top right corner to edit it freezes and then crashes and the app closes all together. I have tried restarting the app, restarting my phone, almost every option available but it still crashes.  Wth.","Negative","Business","Dep,Usa"

Not useful.","Negative","Business","Dep"

"Most of the people who use this app are servers, if I'm making 200250 a night shift, 3 is nothing.

And it is.","Negative","Business","Dep"
"I love this app it's super easy to use and very convenient. I just wish you would add the feature to allow a profile photo cause I have hundreds of coworkers which I'm trying to remember their name or who they are but I can't put their name to a face. So it would make this app 5 stars","Positive","Business","Mis"

"This appwebsite is not worth it There are several other options out there for scheduling, and are completely free They recently added an update to make things more difficult, stating it's what we asked for. I'm just curious who asked for it Working on getting our company off of HotSchedules and on to better things. This app is not recommended. Keep your money ","Positive","Business","Usa"

"From the website, the new logbook set up is awful and not very functional. The old version was much easier to scroll logs and replies when scanning for specific details. It also used to put log notes in order of the time the were entered. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for the ordering now. ","Negative","Business","Usa"
"I would like to be able to see everyone who is scheduled to work on days that I do. For instance , I can only see people whose job title is the same as mine cashier. I want to see servers, bartenders etc as well. Please fix for iPhone ","Positive","Business","Mis"
"Not very versatile or functional. You can't view previous day's schedules or the weekly schedule as a whole or see the weekly schedule with coworkers. The app constantly crashes and you have to log in separately online as its a different forum than the app. The worst employee scheduling app ever ","Negative","Business","Dep,Usa"
"Idk what happened, but now I can't look at my schedule. It won't load and barely let me log in. You'd think an app that i paid for would work fine. Seriously hoping this gets fixed then I'll return to 5 stars because other than all of that this app was fantastic.","Positive","Business","Dep"
"Can't do anything on the app anymore ","Neutral","Business","Mis"
"The worst app. You have to have the most recent iOS to run it, still crashes, and the browser on your phone always has difficulty loading the pages. You have to press everything twice, and trying to send messages, the text you type never shows up. I'm a very savvy, smart, phone user, and this app and website make me feel like I've never used a smart phone before. And the service isn't great either. I emailed about a problem specifically laying out my problems and got an email back talking to me like I've never used a phone before and asking me questions I had already answered. Just awful. Don't give them any more money.","Negative","Business","Dep,Usa"

One quibble it's been exactly two years now without an update from the developers. This is app ranks as the 18th most popular paid app on the store, so I'm at a loss as to why there is no development support for this app. There are compatibility issues to remedy and a few bugs to squash.

Before I got this app, I was pure skin and bones, no joke, weighing around 110 pounds 16 years right now I did have love handles, ugh After two months of doing a circuit each and every day, I have burned a lot of my love handles and have gained lots of muscle. My abdomen is more visible and I can finally see myself flex  I've unlocked three bonuses and I do 4 out of the 5 workouts a day.

"After trying many of the other 7minute workout apps, I conclude that this one is my personal favorite, note the personal. Most of the other one require you to pay for other features when this app gives it after the initial purchase. The workout itself is amazing because I can keep my device turned off and the workout will still continue. The addons in this app are also great, but I feel like the initial workout is enough. The reasons why I gave this a 45 instead of a 55 is because of the lack of updates and the improvements there could be on the app to accommodate more recent devices, like the iPhone 6 or 7. Since it is out of date, the app drains a bit more battery on newer devices than it does on older ones your device will send you a notification of this issue when using the app as a reminder. In the end, this is a very good app for those who, like myself, do not have the time to workout for long periods of time in an expensive gym. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone.","Positive","HealthFitness","Per,Sup"

The App developer needs to update this app for compatibility. After clearing the prompt, I received another popup saying Rate our app Rating the app helps us make free updates  I thought paying for the app allowed the developer to make updates, which is why it was disappointing to be hit with these two prompts. For those considering a purchase, wait until the developer makes one of those promised free updates to improve compatibility. Hopefully this review will help them do that.

"The general information is ok, but even after setting all the correct information for notifications, I get absolutely no notices of severe weather, lightning, or even rain coming.

"Very clunky and often just incorrect info.  There are much better apps for weather. I like Radar Scope and Wunderground weather. ","Positive","Weather","Usa"
"App needs serious improvement. Will not find my location showing at least 160 north of actual location. Radar is cheesy at best, poor refresh rate, very slow  inaccurate also.

For example, I will have gotten several alerts from another weather app before I receive even one from this one. I live in central Ga. we get some pretty bad storms in the spring and summer. I don't know why this is the case but if the timeliness of the notification can be corrected I would rate as 5","Positive","Weather","Per"

"As with all good apps, it can get a need for software updates.

"If another noaa radar app wasn't out there offering heaps more functionality for a similar price then I might give this app more stars. Currently I can not find a feature in this app that offers layouts for a temperature map, wind speed, water temperature, and even a storm path layout, as is available in another app similar to this one. All I see is the option to view information for specific locations by enteringtapping around a location. The only layout I can find is storm coverage by layout I dont mean satellite view.. Sad to see this app charging people over 4 3.99 at 30 off for what Notification functionality  ","Negative","Weather","Mis"
"On the other hand the widget and notification features are a strong point in this app.. But notifications require location services to be ALWAYS ON and as you see on first opening the app their is a big fat privacy star next to this. If your fine with your location being used for ad content then you might not consider this a con.  ","Positive","Weather","Dep"

"Updated review As you can read below, I loved this app. Unfortunately, it hasn't been updated in ages but main issues are with accuracy. It's pouring outside yet no alert, and app says otherwise. Another ex of this is fact I own both weather live as well as this app both from same developer yet info varies dramatically. Temperatures shown up to 10 difference, and neither seem to agree on anything. I'm hoping this will be fixed in future. Apalon is a great company and I own most of their apps.

"I have to say that after using this app compared to the multitude of other weather notification apps that I have, I am not impressed at all. I live in Savannah, GA where we get some pretty bad weather from time to time and I like to know when that weather is on my back door. Just recently we had a mild tornado outbreak, as well as a slew of severe thunderstorms. Of all of the apps that I have for weather with the notifications turned on, NOAA was the very last app to give me a notification that the storm was happening, and at times that notification was almost an hour after the storm had passed. If this was the only app that I had giving me notifications, my family and myself could have wound up seriously injured or worse if just one of those tornado producing storms had hit my house and I was relying on this app. The sad thing is that this is a paid app, that I purchased for a little bit of reassurance during bad weather to give me some piece of mind and the only thing it has done is make me more weary about severe weather in my area. And for anyone that reads this and is wondering, this has not been the only time that the app has been extremely delayed in letting me know that there was bad weather approaching. It happened in April, as well as January, during the tornado outbreak across GA. So basically, it's not a fluke. ","Negative","Weather","Dep"

It repeatedly is reporting the daily high of the day in the mid 60's when the actual temp is actually in the mid 70's or higher. I should add that Storm is reporting the correct temperature.

"This app has always had two significant issues that make it impractical. 1. It always starts incredibly zoomed in, meaning you have to pinch zoomout several times to see incoming weather. I don't know about you, but I can usually tell if it's raining at my current location by opening my eyes. I need to know what's on the way, not what's already here. 2. When you begin zooming out, your city's name pops up in a bubble that covers the city and, in my case, a significant portion of my state. This blocks my view of the weather itself. And I live in a rather large Midwestern state, so it's ridiculous that the city name scales larger and larger as you zoom out, covering the state. It's just bad design, and I don't know why no one else is bothered by the poor functionality and lack of customization. This isn't worth 4. ","Negative","Weather","Dep,Usa"

That's right it doesn't give you a forecast for today. And if I hadn't watched the weatherman this morning I wouldn't know today has the potential of having a severe weather outbreak. Forecasts for days in the future consist of two words at most. Inexplicably Saturday is forecast as 'Clear.' But the chance of rain is 70. Tomorrow shows 'Light rain.'  Chance of rain, 0.

A hilarious example of this I discovered today while trying to explain radiation to someone using the app. I found not only the etymology, similar words, and a few other tidbits but 670 rhyming words for radiation as well as the scrabble score of the word radiation. If you're just going to buy a trivia app then this is the one for you.

I would like to know what I'm looking at in the sky and thought this app would help but there seems to be no connection between my iPad and the display this app provides. Sky Walk says I'm looking east when my iPad is aimed at the setting sun. It shows I'm looking at the full moon in the middle of a dark sky.

It does everything, and is so accurate.  Immediately thought of gifting it to each of my kids.  Start viewing the sky, day or night, by lifting the iPad to the sky, zoom in for more detail, and watch it follow your movements and the stars move on the screen very accurately.  You can even adjust visual magnitude in settings to adapt to your present light pollution levels.","Neutral","Education","Mis"

"The night mode which well preserves the night vision  a great thing in general has one big mistake I want to believe so in catalogue it leaves the images of celestial objects completely untouched. And if we consider that these can be of colossal brightness, the fact spoils a lot of pleasure from stargazing.","Positive","Education","Dep"
"I personally would like this app to have an option to turn on H.A. Rey's constellation lines, which are extremely useful because of combining advantages of maximum correspondence of constellation images to their names and of using only real stars and, hence,  the ability to find the abovementioned cool images in the sky. The starattaching lines, used on this app, have no sense for me, and that's why I use them only to differentiate one constellation from another. ","Positive","Education","Mis"

This is also a great history lesson, too. I use this frequently when camping to learn and to just try to match what I see above me. The inclusion of all the satellites, their trajectory, and their purpose is also interesting. Absolutely nothing bad about this app Well done","Positive","Education","Mis"

"I have a few fairly minor complaints but I'd way rather use swype than the built in keyboard so I will deal with them. The biggest is that it's not very stable. A few times a week, it'll crash and get stuck on numbersymbol page. So I go into settings  keyboards  turn off full access then turn it back on and it'll usually solves the issue. Also, pretty pretty please add a voice to text button. Another complaint is about the emojis. Why am I stuck with the default old emojis There are so many fun new ones and I hate the yellow original ios ones. My final complaint is, I wish when I pressed and held the Swype button to change keyboards, it operated like the iOS keyboard and bitmoji and by that I mean, show a list of the other keyboards instead of next keyboard. Other than those things, Swype has improved my Apple experience immeasurably.","Positive","Utilities","Dep,Usa"
"I've been using Swype for a few years now and have always loved it. Recently it seems, whenever an incorrect word weird is typed topped, the autocorrect is giving strange choices to replace the incorrect words. Most are not close except maybe the first letter, and words appearing from my swyped spellings are very strange  see words above in parentheses. Not sure what's going on but will soon be looking at other keyboard apps. It's taking a lot longer to txt than it used to I have to reread everything. When i typed the comma in second sentence above, it kept trying to capitalize the T after.  Make it great again","Positive","Utilities","Dep,Usa"

Get rid of the nonEngland Enjoys, Engulfs, Engulfs, English nonEnglish With a Droid, my finger could fly over the keyboard and I was astounded at the accuracy. With my iPhone, I have to slow way down and be extremely careful to go back a and correct the gibberish. If it were all English words, I could understand that. But much too often, Swype is giving my me writers words that are not in the dictionary. ","Positive","Utilities","Dep"
"Often, what I get looks like it could be another language. I've checked the languages in my Stubbs settings. English is the primary language. German, French, and  are grayedout.

"SWYPE you had such a great app for androids. You've completely messed it up for iPhone I'm dumping you and looking for another app. ","Neutral","Utilities","Mis"
"I have turned off autocorrect, but this app continually changes words without reason. It's very frustrating because it also doesn't give you the option of your original word when going back to correct. Also, the entire keyboard freezes and forces you to change active keyboards in settings before it works again. This app has so much potential, but the developers seem to hate efficiency. Or maybe they just hate people, because this certainly doesn't make life easier.","Negative","Utilities","Dep,Usa"
"Been using for two months. I'm not going to correct this review doo you can see for yourself some of the things it annoys me with. It usually defaults to too when you want just to. It usually defaults to off when you want off.... Of. See, just did it. Some of the more common English words or changed to the less common use. Just in the example. Of is more popular than off and to is more popular than too. ","Positive","Utilities","Dep"

At first I tried several apps hoping to get close but they all stunk I gave up  Fast forward years later and a couple different iPhones in between...

"LOVE that this Swype is the same if not better than the one included in the Android platform. Who has time to punch out each letter I can Swype far faster than even typing and can Swype as fast as talking in most cases. Have no idea why people don't all use it.

None of them come close to the ease of use, accuracy, and user friendliness of Swype. If you want frills and thrills then this app is not for you. But if the thing that matters most to you is being able to Swype when you text then this app is for you. And a big plus for me is not having to switch to the number keyboard to type numbers and symbols which I absolutely hate a long press gets you there.

It's the fastest and smartest learning keyboard out there and should be at least 4 stars average.

I also noticed that the emoji screen offered doesn't have all the emojis as when using the iPhone keyboard. It would be nice to be able to talk to text also without changing keyboards.

The reviews have brought my attention to a glitch I've been experiencing which is my keyboard sometimes will not open. I just close out and sleep via power button then usually in 3 seconds it will open back up. Swype bug Maybe. Not a big deal to me. Swype increases my phone fondness two fold... seriously.

"The app is kind of buggy, so I won't repeat what other reviewers have already said. My only complaint is that I have to go back to the regular keyboard to use an emoji that is my complexion as I can't change the shade of emojis using the Swype keyboard. Come on guys.","Negative","Utilities","Dep"
"This thing works sometimes but it's so freaking frustrating when it fails to load. It gets stuck on the numbers screen or the keyboard just plain doesn't show up. Also, it doesn't keep deleted words deleted. It seriously needs an update but it hasn't gotten one in like years.","Negative","Utilities","Dep"
"Edit  HELLO Is anybody at Swype paying any attention Read these comments. We are all complaining about the same thing and from day one. I am downgrading to 4 stars. More times than not, Swype will pull up a blank keyboard that will allow no input whatsoever, I can't even change back to generic Apple keyboard when this happens. I have to power down to fix it. But it just happens again a few hours later. I can't use it anymore. It has to be fixed. AUTOCORRECT is still terrible. Still changes common words like this to an obscure word like rusty or have to gaffe, etc. STOP IT Other swiping apps are getting better. The gap is closing. You are going to lose customers if you don't remedy these issues.  ","Negative","Utilities","Dep"
"Swype is a great app and I give it 5 stars. If you disagree, try some of the other swiping apps. That said, why is it you cannot fix the issues that have plagued the app since day one Autocorrect cannot be turned off. The toggle onoff button is useless. This is how it has always been. Of course, nobody wants it permanently off, but I'd rather that than deal with Autocorrect's habit of changing common words to the most obscure word possible. When I type awesome, why are you changing it to sardine How often do you think the word sardine is used by your average English speaker You can't fix this And finally the personal dictionary. Why have an option of manually adding words to my personal dictionary when you will add them on your own You add email addresses and other useless words to the dictionary with no input from me. These issues have been prevalent for years.","Neutral","Utilities","Mis"
"This is the best keyboard with Swype on the market in my opinion. That is, when it's working. If they can get this thing working properly and consistently, I would give it 5 stars easily. I love the accuracy and the layout of the keyboard. I really like how you can long press letters and they turn into the corresponding number. The other reason I gave this 2 stars is another major problem. I purchased a theme black keyboard on two separate occasions and both times I had to delete and redownload the app to hopefully get it working properly after it was acting extremely buggy. Please reimburse or give me my keyboard back.","Positive","Utilities","Dep"

"It is regularly inaccurate, it autocorrects, and auto spaces inconsistently. It's very buggy. It used to be a joy to type with like four years ago, but it has been a slow decline.

"I was a swype user back when I was on Android, and I was happy to see my favorite third party input solution coming to iOS, however, they don't seem to care for updating on IOS platform nearly as much as they do on Android or have they stopped updating there as well . It often stucks at a blank screen, problems like such have not been solved throughout their super slow and very few updates. And I wonder why they support so many languages already on Android, but way less on IOS. No matter how users express their need, they just don't seem to care.","Positive","Utilities","Dep,Per,Usa"

"The keyboard itself is unstable won't open reliably, most notably in Gmail and Messages. ","Negative","Utilities","Dep"
"I love the shortcut gestures, but some still are either buggy or aren't intelligent enough yet. Often a comma erases the letter before it and replaces it with a space also, typing emoticons is a bit of a hassle because it autocorrects the space and pushes the colon back up against the text there are similar but opposite problems with quotes and parentheses, where a space will be added where none is needed. ","Negative","Utilities","Dep,Usa"
"Autocorrect needs to be more obvious when it replaces a phrase. I will look at the word I just typed, see that is correct, and move on, only to sometimes catch later that an entire phrase has been replaced incorrectly. Makes for an aggravating experience. I like what they are trying to do, but the intelligence isn't there yet. Phrase replacement ought to be an option than can be turned off.  ","Positive","Utilities","Usa"
"I've tried all the other swiping keyboards and always come back to this one because of the punctuation gesture shortcuts and how easy it is on the dark keyboard to long press for other punctuation marks.

"I've had Swype since it was an Android only option. After I switched to iPhone platform, I waited anxiously for Swype to release a compatible app. I've used it since, but finally had to quit and try other options. Swype crashes constantly, requiring rebooting of the phone or reloading of the app. It's infuriating. But the details on this keyboard make it awesome. Fix your bugs, and I'll come running back.","Positive","Utilities","Dep"
"This keyboard I believe is probably the only keyboard on iOS which I haven't ever received a strange crash with even back when the code was buggy in iOS 8. With that being said, development cycle for this application is incredibly slow. Would be cool if they would actually fix some of the glaring issues with the keyboard. Those being related to the main reason you would use this keyboard, the swipe function is incredibly buggy. If the user does it too quickly, remnants of the slide trail before remain on the keyboard. Also the resolution of the trails is terrible and has been since keyboard launch in iOS 8. There's also random letters which the key press popup is delayed. Specially the letter Q, the last one not a huge issue but annoyingly lazy it still happens over two years later. If these couple of issues were fixed, this would 100 be best iPhone keyboard.","Positive","Utilities","Dep,Sup,Usa"

"I really missed Swype when I switched to my iPhone from my Galaxy S6 so I looked it up here and installed it. It's working alright. A big drawback is no emoji's and no capability to use voice to text in this keyboard. I have to switch between keyboards to use voice to textemoji's. In my opinion, that's kind of a fail on the part of the Nuance Communications. ","Negative","Utilities","Usa"

"I LOVE Swype on android. However, there are a ton of issues with iPhone. This includes autocorrect with numbers, which is frustrating. What is most inconvenient is the freezing. The keyboard will freeze and I can't even switch to the regular keyboard to continue typing. Once frozen, the keyboard will not work on any app including text message and safari. The phone needs to be restarted for the keyboard to work again. This happens at least once per day and probably 12.5ft that was supposed to be 1.5 but it autocorrected times per day.

"I had a Swype keyboard on my last LG phone and I truly can never go back. I always had a hard time punching out words with the tiny tiles and then this happened and I can respond as fast as or faster than I can receive. It's truly the most wonderful keyboard and I can't imagine typing on a mobile device without it. By now, so many are used to thumb typing but, I encourage those tappers to try swyping for a week or so you only need one hand. It's a beautiful thing","Positive","Utilities","Mis"

"Weird words tired typed mostly on one line give this keyboard fits. The avoid android version eventually learns and gets better. This doesn't. It also rarely had has the right word in the list of choices, so you have to toe type it manually, or make really exaggerated stored swipes so it figures it out. It also likes to change stuff after Macias manual typing, wasting tins tons of time. ","Negative","Utilities","Mis"
"Typing numbers is another major problem. You can't long press keys to get digits like android, and the keyboard goes back to Keyes letters after one number. Do so it takes two keepers keypresses per number. ","Positive","Utilities","Usa"

And there is no way to switch keyboards when this happens. This started last year and hadn't gotten any better.","Negative","Utilities","Dep"
"Second most annoying is the keyboard switch. I use other keyboards with unique capabilities but switching between is annoying because only the swype keyboard requires a long press.

I played emailphone tag with the company, Navionics, but every time I called them it was at least a two hour wait time on hold ...TWO HOURS ON HOLD  Then, Navionics blamed iTunes and iTunes blamed Navionics for me not getting the renewal I paid 4.99 for.  Neither Navionics nor iTunes will correct this problem because they're both blaming the other for the problem.  Meanwhile, I got burned out of 4.99 FOR NOTHING.  To add insult to injury, I've paid for other in app purchases through this same app, but if I can't renew the subscription they're WORTHLESS.  At least 30.00 wasted and Navionics nor iTunes cares one bit about it. ","Negative","Navigation","Mis"

For only 10 I was wondering how this would work since they sell their USA lake map chip for 200... When you start the app or at any time you select the area you want to download  I'd imagine there is a limit. I downloaded several of my surrounding counties which got me all of the corresponding lake maps in excellent detail. ","Positive","Navigation","Mis"

"The new updated made the app really glitchy if I try and use the navionics portion of the depth finder it won't even read the whole lake it just stops and cuts everything off. So in most of the lakes you want to fish you have to use the sonar feature but that only works best if you buy something else as well and even then not all the lakes look great and like they're supposed too.","Positive","Navigation","Dep"

"Although the iPhone app may not be accuratesafe enough for realtime navigation, the disclaimer makes that clear, and the details and technology of the app are excellent for information and planning.

"Great to get a general layout of the lake. Depth contours can be a little off in their accuracy. If you can figure out which way it's off you're golden. Wanted to fish near a sand bar and stopped short of it on the map but was nearly on top of it. Had to reverse twenty feet or so to find the drop off which then said it should have been shallow again.

"The app works great for its intended purpose but it has a flaw that ruins it. For some reason they placed a very light colored link that easily blends into the background to something called openstreet. It is placed right in the middle lower section so almost every time you try to scroll your map, the link will get activated and it takes you to this website and away from your map. It is very worrisome if you are tracking your way points through a tough channel and suddenly your map is gone. I have the paid version of navionics too. If they could get rid of that stupid link it could be a great app. ","Negative","Navigation","Usa"

"Literally the most beneficial fishing tool I have ever came across, specifically when targeting areas ice fishing, due to the fact that, unlike most chat plotters used on open water, most ice flashers do not have any means of navigation or topography. Simply pull out your phone and hop on the sled to quickly target designated contour areas and composition changes. An absolute game changer. Best part... ITS FREE. Why not spend the money on the rods we know your gonna buy anyways because when do we ever stop buying new fishing gear. I will also have you know this is the only app review I have ever written, due mainly because I'm pretty confident I use this app more then the text messaging and calling features on my phone.","Positive","Navigation","Mis"

Also it's great to be able to download areas so that I don't need cellular coverage to use the maps. Well worth the 10 bucks. Thanks","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"Can't say enough good things about this app. I boat a lot and always have this app running while I boat. Saved me from running into shallow water. I love looking at the saved tracks and reviewing my trips. Top speed, total distance traveled, ect. Works even where you don't have cell coverage. Just make sure you download the maps a head of time.

To use these for navigation on a unfamiliar lake would be a big mistake. If you can't rely on these for navigation how helpful will they really be for fishing Bottom line is cross check the maps on this app with reliable maps from another source. ","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"The new version rids the app of customizing what you see on the screen. I use this app on my iPhone 5s and the bloody marina icons crowd the screen real estate.

What sold me on this App I put in at a very little off the chart boat ramp one afternoon to go shrimping and the channel out was marked by PCV pipes with shallows on either side.  Coming in well after sunset I could not find these little PVC markers so, Navionics to the rescue I just followed my out bound Track right back in. It put me between these little PCV markers that I could not even see until I was passing them.  Worth every penny and saved me hundred of dollars. No need for a GPS unit.

I would recommend it to anyone who fishes","Positive","Navigation","Mis"

I called Navionics and questioned them about upgrading the older ap and they told me that ITunes store required a new purchase.  This is total BS.  I have spent over 1,000 on the Navionics SD cards and Navionics Planner software and then they treat their customers like crap.

Why wasn't the font from the old app used It was bolder, antialiased, and much easier to read.","Positive","Navigation","Dep,Usa"
"This app does it all link it between your new wifi units with Navionics chip and Navionics app to plan routes and mark waypoints and us Navionics sync to transfer between each other.  Would recommend adding the in app upgrades to get Navionics  for all the freshest data for a year and the newest addition the sonar charts.  With the advances and continual updating of the charts well worth the money.  If you like plotting routes I would recommend you add the navigation module along with autorouting option.

"Of the app would stay open under navigation it would of gotten a higher star ","Neutral","Navigation","Mis"
"The review below originally had one star. Navionics actually resolved the issue and emailed to inform me. WOW","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"This app is great with plenty of features such as the newly added auto routing.  Recently add ons have been released quite frequently.  The ONLY thing this app lacks is headup that isn't based on the inaccurate iPhone compass heading.  If it used the same method the app uses to point the arrow on the map, it would be perfect.","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"The app itself is very good. The auto routing update does not work and kept freezing up. It also casused my iphone 4 to crash and have not been able to restore. Stay far away far away.","Positive","Navigation","Sup"
"Awesome app in general Get it well worth it. Minus one star for the new Auto routing inapp purchase...  not as nearly as useful as I had hoped. I expected it to at least follow Navigation rules. And yes boat settings are set correctly. I regret spending money on this inapp purchase . The auto route had me going across sand bars and islands Needs some serious tweaking ","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"Great but many lakes in SD and MN are not correct for depth. Please fix Then would be a 5 star app.","Positive","Navigation","Dep"
"There is no longer an option to adjust current lake depth. This feature is a must have so please add it. ","Positive","Navigation","Usa"
"App functions properly and has good menu options. The one huge downfall is that you cannot zoom in far enough to have a good idea what depth your at. Example fishing rivers or lakes with steep dropoffs. ","Positive","Navigation","Usa"
"Have used this app for years.  Upgraded to iPhone 5 and the latest operating system.  Then Navionics provided an update.  Now it won't run.  It crashes on startup every time.  Works on my iPad.  Unfortunately, I don't always have my iPad with me when I am am talking fishing with my friends.  My iPhone is there.","Positive","Navigation","Dep,Sup"
"I'm not sure what happened.  It was working fine, and then one day decided to crash.  I've deleted and reloaded the app several times.  It works for the first time, and then after I've navigated away from it, I can't relaunch.  It looks like it starts, and then crash.","Negative","Navigation","Dep"

"Marked a spot ice fishing and could not get back on the structure using this app.  The crib was on the map but way off and my actual GPS location was off as well.  Made it impossible to find my spot again.","Positive","Navigation","Dep"
"I bought the 5 in app upgrade because everything navionics has done so far has been great. This was a waste. They add some minor functionality that available for free in several other places. This better not be an indicator of things to come. ","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"It's a pitty that app functionality updates such as the nav module and advanced map options are extra.  ","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"Overall it's a great app. You can study the lake wherever your at. I have navionics on my boat, computer, iPad, and iPhone. The only downfall of this app is that the iPhone won't sync waypoints. Apparently at one time it did because I do have some on the iPhone that are on other devices too but I guess one of the navionics updates might have messed it up.","Negative","Navigation","Sup"
"Got lost out in the river in the thickest fog I'd ever seen. This app is the ONLY reason we made it home. We drove in circles out there for an hour and a half before I finally found this and purchased it. Worth every penny.","Negative","Navigation","Mis"

"If you fish much, you can use up that limit very easy.","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"Tried to open yesterday and the initializing screen loads, and loads and loads, but the app doesn't launch.  Had worked fine sine purchasing this summer.  I love this app but.......","Positive","Navigation","Dep"
"Works great Works for iPhone 5 screen size. Would have given 5 stars if there was a water level offset.","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"Great app however, I boat on the upper Niagara River and Lake Erie. Since both these waters are an international boarder, there is no coverage of Canadian waters. It would be great if these boarder areas were included.","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"Caveat emptor as app uses true not magnetic for course and direction. If you are in an area of high magnetic variation and do not account for it manually then you will miss your mark. Remember 1 degree of course error in 60 miles is 1 mile. ","Negative","Navigation","Mis"
"I've been using this app to navigate from the Chesapeake Bay area down to Florida and love it I'm delivering a 50 foot catamaran and the electronics on board are useless. I've had to rely on this app on both my iPhone and iPad and it had been extremely helpful. The ease of use is great, accuracy has not been a problem, and pulling into new inlets every night has been easy with this app. ","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"It does have a few issues. I use the track quite often to see the days progress. The problem is I leave the app running in the background and it usually crashes about twice a day. When it does this the track line is connected with a dotted line to show what it missed, which is great. However, the information at the end of the day is not correct due to it keeps the same start time, but only tells the tracks distance from the last startup point. This makes the total distance, average speed, and fuel consumption way off. ","Positive","Navigation","Dep"
"I purchased this app on a fishing trip in Michigan's upper peninsula. I used it a couple of times and found it to be quite accurate and helpful. On the third outing we had a dense fog roll in and that's when I found out just how useful it can be.","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"I was able to stay clear of shallow waters and navigate a route back to our lodge. The soundings correlated with my fish finder which made motoring much easier.","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"I would recommend this to anyone looking for a navigational aid. As a note, not all lakes show contours, but I think you'll find most, if not all, popular lakes listed.","Negative","Navigation","Mis"
"I use the app on iphone  ipad reference at home for planning.  On the kayak, use it for trips.  Works great.  Easy to expand map for little creeks a kayak can enjoy.

"Great app in Alaska some common sense and alertness on foggy days but ","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"The app functions well, but upon checking the soundings where I work, in New York harbor and where I live, in Annapolis, I found them to be wildly inaccurate. It shows 3 feet if water where the U.S. Sailboat show is currently setting up deepdraft boats for display. In New York harbor, it shows less than 20 feet of water in Northern Stapleton anchorage, where deepdraft ships are anchored. Don't rely on the soundings.","Positive","Navigation","Dep"

"I am impressed with this program. It works very well for a back up to my full system and for the price I think it is well worth it. The one issue I have with it is the overlays do not seem to fit where they belong. If I had a small boat and a smart phone this would certainly be one  great app to have","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"Shows great contour lines and you can plug in coordinates and mark your own waypoints ","Positive","Navigation","Mis"

"Don't buy the app and think you've got the content, it's just an app.  The map downloads are free until updated, but they must be downloaded separately.  If you try to use the app without a wifi connection you'll find yourself needing to download 100MB of maps over your cell connection, or worse. ","Negative","Navigation","Mis"
"There should be an easy way to say download all and get all the maps you've paid for in one step.  Then you could do that at home and forget about it. ","Positive","Navigation","Usa"
"Sweet app out of the box on my 3GS. I was looking for depth charts for the Tennessee river lakes in North Alabama Guntersville, Wheeler, Wilson, and Pickwick. I'm glad I ignored most of the negative reviews. Within minutes I had 500 MB of charts downloaded covering a large chunk of the southeast at no added cost. Resolution is great and accurate so far according to my sonar. Community overlays are a sweet feature too. App also allows overlays of mapping services Google, Bing, etc. Great app so far, and well worth 10. Now I don't need to spend 20 per lake for paper maps","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"I purchased one of their charts and when I got a new Iphone I could not locate the App in the purchased and Not on this phone section. The chart was fine. They want me to pay again for the chart The excuse seems to be that they updated the chart What a rip off Beware these guys are SCAM ARTISTS Their updates are not free.

"Used in Galveston at st. Luis pass and chocolate bay, very hard to navigate some of the shallow waters, this app was spot on, and actually help us out more the my buddies 700 lowrance","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"What I really got it for is to track and save routes, that I take with different fishing buddies and I can say that it was worth every cent.  You really don't need gps on your boat of you have this app.  But, it's nice to have both and this one is portable and you can even save routes that a guide took you on , with out him even knowing.  Tracking routes in shallow water is very important, bc when you try to go back to a spot someone else took you, you will find out they know those waters well and make it look easy.  This is where this app comes most handy for me.","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"US map only has half the Great Lakes including Detroit River.  No more apparent detail than previous versions and Internet is required to download details.  No upgrade path and customer service is useless.  Old version is better but not great either.  Leaves me wishing they could get this right  maybe Lakemap can get something together.  An ipadiphone dual version would be nice since I would hate to pay twice for a bad app.  Support for older maps is horrible and upgrade offers little reward. ","Negative","Navigation","Sup"

"What happened to the Great Lake contours They were on here when I first installed and they are now gone Use to love this app but not so much now. Bring the feature back. ","Positive","Navigation","Usa"
"Good app  will definitely use IF the registration process ever works.  You have to register an account with Navionics to make changes or add favorites to you maps, but you never receive the confirmation email from Navionics to complete the process.  If it isn't fixed, then it's 10 bucks in the lake.","Positive","Navigation","Usa"
"I am a fisherman for inland lakes.This is a gem of an app.  It has a high level of functionality and is as handy as your iPhone.  I find it very useful.  I use it a lot when fishing with friends in their boats.  I can mark a spot and transfer it later to my boat's GPS.  I have also used it, with the guide's permission, to record waypoints when on a guided trip.It also works excellent when navigating to waypoints.  It gives you a current heading while under way and I have found it to be very accurate, both in recording waypoints and also finding spots.I also feel secure having a backup to my main navigation GPS when on my boat that is potent enough to get'r done if I were to need it for something critical like finding your way out of some of the jungles in Texas lakes.This is a HIGH value app at 10.","Positive","Navigation","Mis"

"I don't have enough money for expensive hummingbird gpsdown imaging fish finder. Navonics chip over 100 by itself. This will work for now. Still use maps because the batteries don't die on them. But I don't think this was made to replace good ole maps. Just another tool to play with while trying to jaw jack the big one.","Positive","Navigation","Mis"
"I bought this app last spring and used it for fishing on 5 or 6 lakes in N Texas.  This is a great app for the price. I used it more prior to fishing to mark spots etc.. Once on the lake, It took me right to the spot I picked out and I could also mark a spot for future reference. The only real problem I had was if you mark say a good Crappie hole on the map, everybody who has this app now knows exactly where ur spot is.  For the price, not a bad app. Use it w a depth  fish finder and it will guide u to ur location.","Positive","Navigation","Mis"

"I purchased this last year and used it a few time.  App was great. Found some unmarked underwater structure that wasn't showing on another product.  Since they have come out with a couple of updates.  Well I just opened the app for ice fishing only to see they took off virtually all the contour lines.  For 10 maybe this is what the app should have been, but this app now is NOT what I paid for.  I will not buy anything from navionics again because of what they did with the customers.  At the very least they should have left the app alone for all that had previously purchased it. ","Positive","Navigation","Mis"

"I love this app. Discovered it after having issues with the new iTunes not syncing right on my 5S and have not looked back. My screen got damaged so I went back to my 4S while I wait or the replacement screen and digitizer to come in.  The auto format script is off a bit and I don't have shuttle controls any where but the lock screen. Please fix this. Or tell me how to.","Positive","Music","Sup,Usa"
"I use it in my classroom for transitional and independent study time. It works as it should. Be aware though, it uses audio found in your Dropbox not your phone's memory. ","Neutral","Music","Mis"

"It is really useful and it is my first time using it and it works great","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Amazing app that works exactly as advertised and has all the features one would expect such an app to have, as well as an amazing and easy to use UI. The only features I would love to see added are the ability to see the player itself without having to play a new song and an option to choose photos for your songs that appear in the player and lock screen.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"It work like it is supposed to","Positive","Music","Mis"

"No easy playlist management e.g. can't add an album to a playlist, no queue function, player skips songs when listening to an album with no shuffle. These features are needed and add in the next update please. ","Negative","Music","Usa"
"As a super basic player its decent, but if you plan on using it for a lot of stuff, it gets annoying really quick. ","Negative","Music","Usa"
"Love it Exactly what I was looking for. Now I don't ever have to worry about hooking my phone to a computer and syncing with iTunes. I can now do everything right from my phone and enjoy my music. Has maybe a bug or two, by not letting me play every song for some reason. But hey it's a start and better to be able to do it this way. Thumbs up.","Positive","Music","Dep"
"I usually don't write reviews, but this app deserves it I have an iPhone, and while I love it for its built in music library, I've been having issues getting songs from my computer library synced to my phone. I can now take my downloaded songs, upload easily to Dropbox, and then jump on my phone and have Jukebox upload from there It's super quick, there are ZERO ADS, and I can listen wherever  whenever. Please don't ever go away, Jukebox","Positive","Music","Mis"

"All I get are error messages when trying to get the app to connect with DropBox. I force restarted the phone uninstalled and reinstalled both DropBox and JukeBox and nothing. I wished this app would work because I hate having to keep my phone unlocked to listen to audio on DropBox. Hopefully this will get addressed in a future update.","Negative","Music","Sup"

"I'll tell you that I've spent hours trying to work with iTunes. I've had so many issues with syncing and managing my library. Jukebox is a fantastic tool to bypass iTunes and quickly get songs on your iPhone device. Bravo","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Finally an app that does what is says plays nice and no ads Thank you","Positive","Music","Mis"
"This is a beautifully designed app, no ads is heaven, a few bugs here and there but other then that it's perfect, there really isn't any customer service, I emailed 3 times and got no response","Positive","Music","Mis"

"This app is great and with the right setup you can download music from YouTube right on your phone. This app is easy to use and I use it every day. Amazing","Positive","Music","Mis"
"There is no queuing function, and the shuffler is a bit broken since it would repeat songs before looping through the playlist.","Negative","Music","Usa"
"I had an old app that I could directly use youtube to mp3 in and that was fantastic. It got taken off the app store so I lost all my music. This app is a great replacement. I can use iFile or a similar app to download a song, export it to dropbox, and then download it to Jukebox. It's a longer process, but it works just as well if not better.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Nothing better than music from your dropbox. Syncing your music to phone has never been easy. However the app still has some issues, esp. It crashes sometimes. Also there is no playpause control button on the program. Please consider to add them.","Positive","Music","Dep,Usa"
"Just found the app on a recommendation and it takes Dropbox music storage up a notch. Complete control over files. Create playlists and even have album art","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Jukebox is a wonderful app and it has helped me save data every month. There are just a few glitches I would like to point out, and if they were fixed this app would be perfect. First, sometimes when I'm shuffling songs jukebox will skip over a song and play the next song in line for no reason. Second, I would like to be able to swipe up from the bottom of my iPhone while I'm not in the app and switch the song this function never seems to work for me on jukebox. Thanks for this app and I hope these corrections will be implemented.","Positive","Music","Dep,Usa"
"Really great app, 100 free, nice UX and no ads","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Works well but I would like to be able to pause my music while my headphones are on. It's kinda annoying wanting and trying to pause it with my headphones and it doesn't. Also, sometimes it'll skip over some tracks in the album. Please fix that.","Positive","Music","Dep"
"Great music player With no ads","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Needs more features but the basics work great. Dropbox import works. random play needs some work.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Really good app, very clean and all that I wanted a music app to be. Especially because I can listen to my music without wifi","Positive","Music","Mis"

"I just want to say that you make life easier by these pretty apps. Sincerely thamks for all your efforts again","Positive","Music","Mis"
"MP3juices.cc is perfect for this app. I love this I have tried too many other apps and this app is perfect. I wouldn't recommend it if it weren't true  So please save yourself the hassle of going through multiple apps just to delete them and download this app now  I do agree with adding your own information and album art tho that would be great","Positive","Music","Mis"
"maybe add lock screen controls fast forwarding and custom eq settings ","Neutral","Music","Mis"
"This app is just great. I have all my favorite songs on here and it's so easy to import more songs.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"I don't think there are any problems with it personally. I put music into my Dropbox folder from YouTube MP3 and it works","Negative","Music","Mis"
"Loaded but will not open. Very disappointing because I wanted to use it with dropbox. Updated iOS fixed it. Now use it and love it. Works well and is easy to upload my music. Wish playlists were easier to make.","Positive","Music","Usa"
"First request..support for song art having the static 'J' on every song takes away from the experience. Second, please please please add support for Google Drive Thank you ","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Fantastic work on this app It's simple, clean, well designed and exactly what I've been looking for. It allows me to avoid the hassle of iTunes and the less than desirable builtin iPhone music player which is a beautiful thing. Also love that it plays wav files natively within the app. Bravo","Positive","Music","Mis"
"I enjoy this app a lot because of how clean it is and all the features already in it but I would like to see a delete button for songs I don't want anymore. And I can't pause the music while I have headphones in, I have to go to the phones lock screen in order to pause it not withe the iPhone headphones. But I still do love this app thank you","Positive","Music","Usa"
"This is a great, easy to use, and good looking app. I have one problem It is that I'm not sure if it's certain song but sometimes it just says an error has occurred while trying to play and skips a bunch of songs other then this great app","Positive","Music","Dep"
"Perfect for playing Dropbox files very happy with it so far.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"This music player is AMAZING No ads, no commercials, no glitches It's perfect ","Positive","Music","Mis"

"ALSO, i have a BIG request and everyone who has ONEDRIVE cloud will agree with me too. CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE A MUSIC PLAYER JUST LIKE THIS ONE FOR ONEDRIVE OR PLEASE MAKE THIS APP SUPPORT ONEDRIVE ALSO ","Positive","Music","Mis"
"I love the concept, but the app just crashes and disappears on my phone. I have 68K tunes in Dropbox Business account, though, so it's understandable if disappointing.","Negative","Music","Dep"
"I love this app, I really do, and I love the fact that I can listen to my music on it. However, sometimes it will bug out. Please find the problem and fix it because it gets a little annoying","Positive","Music","Dep"
"It's great to be able to play my tunes offline. I used to use Spotify, but I never had premium and I was never able to get my clean versions. Saves the hassle of syncing my iPhone, just drop my songs into my Dropbox and have them ready to go. Worth the work to download my songs to the cloud. Thank you ","Positive","Music","Mis"
"It's great but the flaw is the limited space on the app I wish you would update it so it would be unlimited so we could download songs as much as we want","Positive","Music","Mis"
"This app is GREAT but there are a few thing I would like to see.. There should be an option to upload your own album art. Also, I'd love to see a scroller on the side so I can find my songs faster. While using the app, I noticed a few bugs. Whenever I'm listening to music and an alarm goes off when my ringer is on, the music stops completely and doesn't play unless I go back into the app and play it. It should automatically play again after I shut off the alarm. When a notification goes off when my ringer is on, the volume gets all messed up. It's either gets really low and doesn't go back to the setting that I had it at, or it randomly gets very loud. If you could please fix these things I would be more than happy to rate Jukebox 5 stars","Positive","Music","Dep,Usa"
"It's a great app, but I had to take off a star because whenever I try to edit a song the app crashes, I hope you guys are able to solve this problem","Positive","Music","Dep"
"Would love to have an option to just select a folder and make the importing function search to just that one  ","Positive","Music","Mis"
"I couldn't open the app at all. It crashed every time I tapped on it. 010 would not fap again","Neutral","Music","Dep"
"I like this app and how simple it is. However, it would be nice if this app integrated Google Drive also instead of only Dropbox.","Positive","Music","Sup"
"Works perfect and can sync all my music from Dropbox ","Positive","Music","Mis"
"So simple to use, and I just love how clean it looks. Works great","Positive","Music","Mis"
"This app is hella good.. Able to convert songs from YouTube n save to my DropBox. Open my JukeBox and import the songs from DropBox... WaLa","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Sadly I'm unable to use this app. I'm a musician so I have over 10,000 .wav files in my Dropbox and the app won't move past the import screen.  ","Negative","Music","Sup,Usa"
"App indicates that it's compatible with iOS 8.0 or higher. I have iOS 8.4 and this app won't starts. It worked on my other device that has iOS 9.2. Pls either fix the app or correct the inaccurate description.","Positive","Music","Sup"
"This is great no ads at all. It doesn't crash, it's responsive and it's clean. Perfect","Positive","Music","Mis"
"I like to put things in my drop box to hear later so I don't have to do it through iTunes but Dropbox sometimes pauses too much so this comes in clutch when I need it","Positive","Music","Mis"
"No pop up ads, barely any ads for ratings and when you do see them, they aren't intrusive, easy to use, great design. Download this app.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"I don't really like it because it won't let me use it. ","Negative","Music","Mis"
"This app is awesome, and gets many things right. First up, there are no ads, and before the app uses any cellular data it will ask to continue. In addition, the app won't spam you with annoying popups asking for a review, only a little banner at the top that shows up once in a blue moon","Positive","Music","Mis"
"As for the 4 star rating, the app doesn't seem to have any form of shuffle button, which is a bit disappointing ","Negative","Music","Usa"
"Jukebox found music in my Dropbox I forgot was there And now I can listen to that music offline which is pretty sweet for my commute ","Positive","Music","Mis"
"As long as you know how to get music to Dropbox then this is a great app","Positive","Music","Mis"
"This app is sweet. I can listen to music whenever I want to without worrying about using up data and paying more  to the .","Positive","Music","Mis"
"I hated iTunes, specifically because iTunes does not work with my MacBook and my MacBook won't connect with my phone... It's a long story. My only option to get music on my phone was to use Dropbox... I found Jukebox to be an excellent companion to Dropbox. Once I've transferred music over to Jukebox I remove my music from Dropbox to keep my usage at a minimum. ","Negative","Music","Mis"
"My only wish now is if I could transfer music from Jukebox back to Dropbox in case I want to back it up on my computer. ","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Great app, great concept. I like the layout, it's very good. It's smooth but it could be smoother. They need to work on speed and stability but it's not horrible right now. Great app overall.","Positive","Music","Per"
"I sent suggestion for developers of this app and in next update they do it  ","Neutral","Music","Mis"
"Trying to play music from Dropbox without ads is a pain, but this app makes it all go away Thank you","Positive","Music","Mis"
"So far does everything I want it to. ","Positive","Music","Mis"
"A little buggy sometimes, but overall, a nice app","Positive","Music","Dep"
"It would be a lot better if it had support for more cloud storages, like google drive or onedrive ","Positive","Music","Mis"
"I really like the idea of this app, but it's missing a few features, a queue, so you can shuffle the playing order, a shuffle all button, and a play next option. With the inclusion of these things, this app will be perfect But needs these features Great app nonetheless","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Downloaded last version and it does not work. After update still can not load for iphone 5, ios 8.","Neutral","Music","Sup"
"I have a quarter terabyte of files in Dropbox. This app can't get past the import stage. If I could just select a specific folder for audio, it probably would.","Neutral","Music","Usa"
"I found this app amazing and haven't seen a bug so that's why I rated it 5 stars","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Why can't we just select a specific folder to import ","Neutral","Music","Mis"
"I really like this app it does what they advertise. You can easily import music from your Dropbox account. They have now just implemented a new feature that lets you share music with friends that looks promising. Overall great app and user friendly.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"I love this app, one of the best apps to listen to your songs offline also save a lot of space because the songs are .mp3, but when you're listening to the songs sometimes when a song is done the app skip the next song for example you have 3 songs, the 1st song is done so it starts the 3rd song instead of the 2nd idk why but that don't happen much so pls fix it, other than that the app is amazing D","Positive","Music","Usa"
"This app is amazing I can use it everyday Thank you, but I wish I could just select all songs and put them in a playlist instead of having to manually tap on each song to put in in a playlist. Besides that, this app is great ","Positive","Music","Usa"
"I only just started using this recently however I love it. I can store my songs online on Dropbox and play that music through jukebox. Super helpful, way more than I thought when I first downloaded it.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"I don't understand how to login to this It tells me to log in or to open the jukebox app for a new account WHILE I'm in the app in the FIRST place. Ugh, confusing.  ","Negative","Music","Usa"
"Nice app. Please make for iPad UI. Keep it up","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Love this app overall. No ads and offline listening is great, but the app needs more basic features such as editing abulm art, tags, etc. If these are added, this app will be the 1 dropbox music app on iTunes.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"No privacy policy Even the developer website is barren of this information. It's an artist website to make music available to the masses.I just give a random developer my Dropbox password Do you monitor what I'm listening to What permissions does you app get Can the developers access my account or is the key stored locally Absolutely NO IDEA. BEWARE. ","Negative","Music","Dep"
"Once I play a wav file it crashes the app.  Does this app play wav files?","Positive","Music","Dep"
"I love this app so much more cheaper then paying for all your songs though the Apple Music app. Only one problem that I hope they look into is putting a whole bunch of songs in a playlist instead of doing it individually. But other than that great app","Positive","Music","Mis"
"It has a habit of skipping every other song which is perfectly fine except I think in shuffle, it doesn't even play those songs. I really wish it didn't do that but for a free app that doesn't have to do with iTunes, it's superb","Positive","Music","Usa"
"This app is an excellent one so far. I love how well quickly it grabs music from my Dropbox and I the simple dark interface is amazing. However, I noticed that the app isn't compatible with the controls on my Apple lightning earpods and I also noticed that it tends to miss a few songs from the Dropbox folder here and there. Also the home screen controls tend to act funny from time to time. All in all, though, this is a must have app and I hope to see more improvements in the future.","Positive","Music","Sup,Usa"
"This app is incredibly good and stuff but you guys should add more sorting features and just more features in general Gotta update this Great app though.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"I was looking for an app that would let me create playlists from music in my Dropbox, and this is it There was a slight glitch before I created my first playlist, but I restarted the app  chose a song to start a playlist after that it is smooth sailing. Sure, there are a couple of things missing  for instance, I can't sort by artist  but for my needs it is PERFECT.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"I've been looking for a clean UI music player that wouldn't constantly try and discover and recommend new songs based off my tastes.  All I wanted was a player that could download my music off Dropbox and play it  simple as that.  Jukebox does exactly that and is what I have been looking for.  Thank you","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Thank you. I have been looking for an app to just simply play my music and teaching audio files. Most are over complicated, and honestly are hard to deal with.  I also don't want streaming music. For that there's Pandora or a host of other apps.  This app is elegant and does exactly what I have been looking for. Thanks","Positive","Music","Mis"
"From the playlists to the organing options to the offline use...Top 20 app...hope it stays around.","Negative","Music","Mis"
"The only reason I'm not giving this Five Stars is because there's a lock and key in the amount of space I can use. Even after clearing up most of my phone space there's no change.","Negative","Music","Usa"
"So far, I love this app and will change my rating upon an update. It's easy to use and import songs.  BUT.. and it's a big but.. without the ability to scrub playback forwards or backwards, or at least go backforward 10 seconds or so with a button, it's very hard as a music professional to learn, makes charts for, or quickly critique mix issues of songs. Dropbox is primarily a storage or file share app not a music player per se. So having playlist ability is awesome but we need to be able to rewind or at least see a useable, selectable timeline for this to be a truly great app.","Positive","Music","Usa"
"Works flawlessly. Saves me from spending all of my data in 2 days.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Best offline music player I have tried. Superfast at downloading my music from dropbox. I just wish that it would always stay with the shuffle on. I also wish that the playpause buttons would be bigger and that on the lock screen the time would show up larger and not be tiny at the top of the screen. But the shuffle always on is a bigger issue for me because I like it on shuffle.","Positive","Music","Usa"
"Now that apple only has Apple Music I found it hard to listen to all my downloaded music. And with JukeBox and DropBox it's so easy and beautiful","Positive","Music","Mis"
"I've been searching a long time for a free app that downloads music and can play without an internet connection. The extra work of converting the video files to MP3 files in Dropbox is worth it. Plus, there are no advertisements randomly poping up all over the place.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Largely clean and simple UI compared with recent iTunes versions. Still has an unnecessary and undesired clickbait link in the UI to 'discover more music' that links out to some external app in the store for download. ","Positive","Music","Usa"
"Import from dropbox worked well with a small number of test songs, but trying to get it to import 100s of additional songs all normal unprotected mp3 has lead to weird seemingly random import behavior getting just a song or two from each album folder across several dozens of artists and albums never importing in entirety. ","Negative","Music","Usa"
"Also when importing, if you deselect all potential imports there is a trap in the UI from which you can't get back to main lib menu, requiring a force close of the application.","Negative","Music","Usa"
"This app has potential, but it's not the simple iTunesAmazon Musicpersonal cloud killer many if us are looking for. ","Negative","Music","Mis"
"It's the best way to obtain free music. It works very well on my 6S and I've had little to no problems. Easy to use and an all around great app","Positive","Music","Mis"
"the app is really smooth working and plays great the only complaint i have is it skips over songs quite alot but other than that i love it","Positive","Music","Usa"
"I'm assuming most of the 'features' currently lacking will be added over time I.e. File type support, better library management. For now this app allows for a iTunes decoupling, which is plenty.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"PLEASE ADD ANIMATED BACKGROUNDS ","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Thanks, now I can listen to music and download my own stuff from Dropbox with out a dumb music subscription. Genius. 1010","Negative","Music","Mis"
"It's the best app I've had to download and play music for free, but I wish it would let us upload the album covers because the J just doesn't look fitting. That's just my opinion though. Other than that, it's great.","Positive","Music","Usa"
"So easy to listen to my music from Dropbox  first app to do exactly what I wanted","Positive","Music","Mis"
"I mean, Titanplayer was more direct and all, but it's sorta kinda gone. This app's pretty simple and clean and ohso very worth it, even if I need to go that extra mile and change videos to mp3s and move that to Dropbox and from Dropbox to here. There's only two teeny little problems the little pause button on the earbuds doesn't seem to register when I press it, and that little flashy headphone icon doesn't seem to have any way of turning off the multicolor flashing. Aside from that, this app is nearly perfect.","Positive","Music","Usa"
"I like this better than Spinrilla or any other app cause it's like an android but it's not...","Positive","Music","Mis"
"iPhone 6s, current iOS. Skips over songs mp3s in a playlist. Usually around the 6th or 7th track. Imported from Dropbox. Also, would be nice to change the songs in the playlist, and delete them. Thanks.","Positive","Music","Usa"
"Super clean and a simply beautiful app.  I began saving my music through Dropbox a few months ago.  I kept trying to find an app that I could listen to my music with but they just weren't right.  That is until two weeks ago I found this app and it has been my saving grace Honestly the best no doubt I will definitely recommend this to others.","Positive","Music","Mis"
"Using Dropbox to sync audio is invaluable. The restrictive nature of the apple platform is broken apart by this app. I love it. Use it all the time.","Positive","Music","Mis"

"Does the job the right way without introducing any bits of complexity.","Neutral","Music","Mis"
"My only suggestion is to make the layout look more like iTunes or music player. ","Positive","Music","Usa"
"i dont know what id do without it. my only concern however is that whenever i am playing music from jukebox and i get a phone call, i have to close and reopen the app to play music once again. i would greatly appreciate it if it were improved so that the music only pauses when theres an incoming call, as opposed to stopping altogether.

"I was using Dropbox which I like, except I can't listen to more than one song at a time.  It's fine when I have a 30 min meditation to play, but not when I want to hear 4 meditative pieces in a row.  Jukebox is so easy to transfer files and create a playlist.

"I have tried countless times to hear baby with no success. I've thought maybe it's because I haven't been far enough along but I'm 39 weeks now and still nothing. I can hear my heartbeat just fine, but not baby's. All I get is static with baby. I can hear kicks though, which early on when kicks first started was kind of cool to hear. Also it's been a good tool to use if baby hasn't moved around a lot in the day  when I put my phone on my belly the pressure and the noise really makes baby move around. So perhaps that's the problem To be fair, I complained to the developer and they responded quickly, however they basically gave me the instructions on how to use the app quiet room, find your heartbeat first, try the different mode, etc which I had already been doing. I never pay for apps so this one was a disappointment... and I really was hoping it would work. Next baby I will buy a stethoscope.","Positive","Lifestyle","Mis"
"After reading all of the positive reviews, I was excited about this app.  We thought it would be a more affordable option than buying a heart monitor in retail and we wanted to be able to checkin on the baby throughout the pregnancy because we had complications in the past.  Unfortunately, I never once could hear my little ones' heartbeat which was shocking considering we never had issues finding or holding onto a heartbeat in the doctors office. I tried the developer's suggestions to find a quiet room and I also tried to listen at multiple times throughout the day and it never worked.  Even at 39 weeks, I never heard a heartbeat regardless of where I positioned it.  In fact, I had a hard time even capturing my own heartbeat . I gave it two stars because it is easy to use good navigation and userfriendly and offers some good features but since I wasn't able to ever hear a heart beat it was a waste of money.  Since everyone's pregnancy is different, it could just be that I wasn't a good candidate for this type of thing...maybe it would work better for others","Positive","Lifestyle","Dep"

I could hear baby's heartbeat beating away at 8.5 weeks It was a little faint but I could definitely tell that that's what it was. I am now 11 weeks and the heartbeat is much louder and more distinct. When using this app, you do need to be in a quiet place, and it does take a little bit to get used to the difference between the white noise and baby's heartbeat. However, once you find it it's very obvious that it is the heartbeat. Definitely beats the cost of paying for a Doppler and works beautifully. Highly recommend","Positive","Lifestyle","Mis"

"Does what it says beautifully...BUT I had the help of a stethoscope to find the best place to place the phone first If you can get on the closest place to the heart, it'll work like a charm from 2930 weeks on.

"I hear my heartbeat just fine and I'm 35 weeks now. But I don't hear the baby's heart rate at all. And if I try adjusting it around my belly, I get sounds but the sounds are from my movements or accidentally tapping my phone. Not to mention you have to be in a really quiet space.

"Actually worked and I'm only around 78 weeks. You have to be patient with it though. This is my fourth pregnancy and from my own experience, even at the doctors office, the doctor doesn't usually get a good heartbeat immediately, they have to move around a little. You'll have to do the same thing with this app.","Negative","Lifestyle","Mis"

I'm 37 weeks now, and the sounds it's picking up are no different than at 9 weeks. I actually suspect it's playing a sound track and not actually communicating with the mic when it is only picking up faint sounds.","Positive","Lifestyle","Usa"

"I'm 22 weeks pregnant, I was really curious so after reading reviews, I decided to give the app a shot. I tried my own heart beat first and right off I found and deciphered it Next I tried baby.

"So at first I was skeptical but who wouldn't be But after paying the 5 and playing around we actually heard the heart beat. I do have a recording of it as well and you can definitely tell that it is the heart beat. We started around 31 weeks and have played around since. 4 stars because it's not perfect of course. Sometimes it's hard to hear or you can't hear but that also has to do with the baby's location. So, for 5 to get to hear the heart there and there isn't even a question. A cup of coffee or smokes or fast food  ability to hear the heart ... Priceless.","Positive","Lifestyle","Mis"

I can find my babys heartrate no problem w dopplar however tried and tried w this app and no luck.. I feel as though it was a waste of money. I would say spend the extra and get a regular dopplar since apparently they are easier..","Negative","Lifestyle","Usa"
"I was unsure for a while and did plenty of research before I bought this app. It is worth it. Not only to hear my baby heart beat but to see my family and friends light up when they hear it too. I'm at 21 weeks and I couldn't be happier ","Positive","Lifestyle","Mis"

"I got nervous today, thinking I hadn't felt my baby kick quite as often as I usually do. So I decided to give this app a shot. It took me a good 10 minutes of searching, but I finally heard his heartbeat in the midline about halfway between my belly button and my pubic bone I had to use synthesizer mode to hear him, though I could hear my own heartbeat fine with classic mode. It was worth the effort and patience to reassure me that he is still ticking","Positive","Lifestyle","Mis"
"Really  This App doesn't work. I made many tests and nothing.","Neutral","Lifestyle","Dep"
"I wish I could give a good review like the ones I had read. I tried to hear the heart beat all the way from 3036 weeks, but I never had any luck. I was super bummed because I was so excited to read others posts about how they heard their baby after 30 weeks etc. I used it how people said to use it as well, and maybe my baby was laying weird to not be able to. Just bummed I  wasted money on it.....","Positive","Lifestyle","Usa"
"I can't believe this app doesn't offer something as basic as beats per minute. Without that you really have no idea if you're actually hearing the baby's heartbeat, your own heartbeat, or just static from moving the phone around. I want my money back, I have no reason to ever use this again. ","Negative","Lifestyle","Usa"

"Those who say this doesn't work are 1 not using it right or 2 their placenta is making it harder to find baby's beat. It doesn't pick up early on, but if you use it as instructed, 30 weeks it works like a charm. Love being able to record my lil ones heart beat. I find it in seconds because I know exactly where his back is. Great app","Positive","Lifestyle","Mis"
"Don't waste your money on this app.  All you hear is static. Wish I could actually hear the heartbeat. I'm uninstalling it.","Positive","Lifestyle","Usa"
"I was skeptical but as an extremely excited dad i felt this app would be an extra  connection to my baby for me if it worked. We tried early on at week 8 and couldnt get anything. We tried again every few weeks. After week 24 we kind of gave up until week 32. It didnt take 20 seconds and could hear it loud and clear. It was music to my ears. I give the app 5 stars bc it does everything it claims to do. It also says that you get the best results between week 3040, which was true in my case. So i say the app is worth the money cheaper than doplar, but wait till at least week 25 to try.","Positive","Lifestyle","Mis"
"I thought I had wasted my money on this because I bought it very early in my pregnancy and used it so many times hoping to hear the heartbeat but it was just too early Today at 31 weeks and 6 days I heard it loud and clear Very cool feeling ","Positive","Lifestyle","Mis"

"Im at 28 weeks, and I was able to listen to my babys heart beat You just need to follow the instructions theres a video. I also recommend you to listen to the sample sounds, just so that you would have an idea of what you are looking for. It doesnt sound like the Doppler or your doctors fancy ultrasound, but you can definitely hear your babys heart . I love it","Positive","Lifestyle","Mis"
"I have had this app downloaded since I was maybe 15 weeks pregnant. Since my placenta is in the back of my uterus, I have had no issues feeling my sweet baby boy move since 15 weeks or hearing his sweet little heart beat with this since 23 weeks. I am now 30 weeks and I can find his heart beat every day with this. Its very good and Im happy this is free because I didnt want to spend 60 on a doppler. I totally recommend this app to any pregnant woman who wants to hear their sweet bub. I would suggest waiting until around 25 weeks to make sure you can actually can pick up the heart beat, but dont be discouraged if you dont at that point. The app suggests you wait until youre between 30 and 40 weeks and I have had no difficulty finding his heart beat now that I am 30 weeks. Earlier it was a little bit difficult. Make sure you use airplane mode when youre looking for the heart beat though and that youre in a quiet room.","Positive","Lifestyle","Mis"
